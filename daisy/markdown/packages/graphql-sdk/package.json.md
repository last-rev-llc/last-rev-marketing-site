**Summary:**
This configuration file is used in a larger application for managing dependencies, scripts, and other settings. It specifies the name, version, main file, license, files to include, and whether there are any side effects. It also includes a list of scripts that can be run, peer dependencies, dependencies, and dev dependencies.

**Service:**
The configuration file is not specific to a known service. It is used in a larger application to manage various aspects of the project.

**Configuration Summary:**
The configuration file sets up the project's name, version, main file, license, and files to include. It also defines scripts for building, cleaning, installing dependencies, downloading schemas, code generation, formatting, linting, testing, and running the application in development mode. Additionally, it specifies peer dependencies, dependencies, and dev dependencies.

**Configuration Breakdown:**
