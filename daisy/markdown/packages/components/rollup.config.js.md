Summary:
This code is a configuration file for the Rollup bundler. It exports a default configuration object that specifies the input file, output directory, format, and other options for the bundling process.

Import statements:
- `config` is imported from the `@last-rev/rollup-config` package. This package likely contains a pre-defined configuration object for Rollup.

Script Summary:
The script exports a default configuration object for Rollup. It specifies the input file as `./src/index.tsx`, the output directory as `dist`, the output format as `cjs` (CommonJS), and enables sourcemaps. It also sets the `babelHelpers` option to `'runtime'`, which indicates that the bundled code should use Babel's runtime helpers. Finally, it sets `preserveModules` to `true` and `preserveModulesRoot` to `'src'`, indicating that the bundled code should preserve the module structure and the root directory for modules should be `'src'`.

Internal Functions:
None

External Functions:
None

Interaction Summary:
This configuration file is used by the Rollup bundler to determine how to bundle the code in the `./src/index.tsx` file. It may be used in a build script or a build tool to generate the bundled output.

Developer Questions:
- How can I change the input file to a different file?
- How can I change the output format to something other than CommonJS?
- What other options can I configure in this file?
- How can I disable sourcemaps?
- What does the `babelHelpers` option do and when should I change it?
- What does the `preserveModules` option do and when should I change it?
- What does the `preserveModulesRoot` option do and when should I change it?
