Summary:
This code is a module that creates and retrieves palette accents for a color scheme. It exports two functions: createPaletteAccents and getPaletteAccents. The createPaletteAccents function creates palette accents based on color schemes and stores them in an object. The getPaletteAccents function retrieves the created palette accents.

Import statements:
- PaletteAccent: This imports the PaletteAccent class from the '../PaletteAccent' module.
- colorSchemes, baseScheme, ColorScheme: These import variables from the '../colors' module.

Script Summary:
The script exports two functions: createPaletteAccents and getPaletteAccents. The createPaletteAccents function creates palette accents based on color schemes and stores them in an object. The getPaletteAccents function retrieves the created palette accents.

Internal Functions:
- createPaletteAccents: This function creates palette accents based on color schemes and stores them in an object.

It then maps over the filtered color schemes and creates a new PaletteAccent instance for each color scheme using the PaletteAccent class. If a paletteAccent is successfully created, it adds it to the paletteAccents object using the color scheme's buildOptions.key as the key. Finally, it returns the paletteAccents object.
