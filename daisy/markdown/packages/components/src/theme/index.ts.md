Summary:
This code is responsible for creating and exporting a theme for a software application. The theme is based on the Material-UI library and includes customizations for various components such as headers, cards, media, and sections. The theme is created using a base theme and additional theme configurations for each component. The final theme is then exported for use in the application.

Import statements:
- `responsiveFontSizes`, `ThemeOptions`, `createTheme` from `@mui/material/styles`: These are functions and types from the Material-UI library that are used to create and customize the theme.
- `Hero`, `Card`, `Media`, `Quote`, `Header`, `Section`, `Link`, `TableOfContents`, `Text`, `NavigationBar`, `NavigationItem`, `Collection`, `CollectionCarousel` from various component files: These are custom component themes that are imported and merged into the base theme to create the final theme.
- `merge` from `lodash/merge`: This function is used to merge multiple theme configurations into a single theme.
- `camelCase` from `lodash/camelCase`: This function is used to convert a string to camel case.

Script Summary:
The script starts by defining a base theme object that includes configurations for spacing, breakpoints, typography, palette, and other theme options. It then defines specific configurations for each component by importing their respective theme functions and passing the base theme as an argument. These component themes are merged into the base theme using the `merge` function. Finally, a `createSchemeTheme` function is defined to create the final theme by merging the base scheme theme with the component themes. The `createSchemeTheme` function is called with the base theme, and the resulting theme is exported as the default theme.

Internal Functions:
- `createSchemeTheme(schemeKey?: string)`: This function takes an optional `schemeKey` parameter and returns a theme object. It first creates a base scheme theme by calling `createTheme` with the base theme. Then, it merges the base scheme theme with the component themes using the `merge` function. The function also includes style overrides for specific components. The resulting theme is then passed to `responsiveFontSizes` to enable responsive font sizes. The final theme is returned.

External Functions:
- None

Interaction Summary:
This script creates a theme that can be used by other components in the software application. The theme provides consistent styling and customization options for various components such as headers, cards, media, and sections. Other components can import and use this theme to ensure a consistent look and feel throughout the application.
