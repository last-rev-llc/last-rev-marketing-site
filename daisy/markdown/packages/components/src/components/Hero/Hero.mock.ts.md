Summary:
This code is a module that exports two mock objects, `heroMock` and `featuredImageMock`, which are used to simulate data for a hero component in a web application. The `heroMock` object represents a hero component with a centered layout and a background image, while the `featuredImageMock` object represents a hero component with a featured image layout. These mock objects can be used for testing or development purposes.

Import statements:
- `mockLink` is imported from the `Link.mock` module. It is used to simulate a link object within the hero component.

Script Summary:
The script defines two mock objects, `heroMock` and `featuredImageMock`, which are variations of a base hero object (`heroBase`). The base object contains common properties and values shared by both variations. The variations differ in their layout and background/image properties.

Internal Functions:
None.

External Functions:
None.

Interaction Summary:
This script does not directly interact with other components or modules. It provides mock data that can be used by other components or modules that require hero data.

Developer Questions:
1. How can I use the `heroMock` and `featuredImageMock` objects in my component?
2. Can I modify the properties of the mock objects to fit my specific use case?
3. Are there any other mock objects or data sources that I can use in conjunction with these mocks?
4. How can I import and use the `mockLink` object from the `Link.mock` module?
