Summary:
This code is a module that provides functions to generate mock data for a Quote component. It exports several functions that return objects with properties representing different variations of a quote. The module also imports dependencies from other modules to generate mock data.

Import statements:
- `random` from 'faker': This import is used to generate a random alphanumeric ID for the quote.
- `mediaMock` from '../Media/Media.mock': This import is used to generate mock data for the author image and logo properties of the quote.
- `QuoteProps` from './Quote.types': This import is used to define the type of the quote object.

Script Summary:
The script exports several functions that generate mock data for a quote component. The `mockQuoteBase` function returns a quote object with default properties. The `mockQuoteOneColumn` and `mockQuoteTwoColumn` functions return quote objects with additional properties specific to the one-column and two-column variants, respectively. The `mockQuoteBase` function is also exported as the default export of the module.

Internal Functions:
- `mockQuoteBase`: This function returns a quote object with default properties. It generates a random alphanumeric ID using the `random.alphaNumeric` function from the `faker` module. It also calls the `mediaMock` function to generate mock data for the author image and logo properties. The quote text, author name, and author title are hardcoded.

- `mockQuoteOneColumn`: This function returns a quote object with properties specific to the one-column variant. It calls the `mockQuoteBase` function to get the base quote object and then overrides the variant and author image properties.

- `mockQuoteTwoColumn`: This function returns a quote object with properties specific to the two-column variant. It calls the `mockQuoteBase` function to get the base quote object and then overrides the variant and author image properties.

External Functions:
- None

Interaction Summary:
This module provides functions to generate mock data for a Quote component. The generated data can be used to populate the quote component in a UI or for testing purposes. Other modules or components in the application can import and use these functions to generate mock quotes.

Developer Questions:
- How can I modify the default properties of the generated quote?
- How can I add additional properties to the generated quote?
- How can I use the generated mock data in my component or test?
