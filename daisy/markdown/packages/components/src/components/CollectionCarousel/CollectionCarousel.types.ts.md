Summary:
This code is a TypeScript module that defines the interfaces and types for the CollectionCarousel component. It provides props and classes definitions for the component, as well as import statements for dependencies.

Import statements:
- `MediaProps` and `CardProps` are imported from the `../Media` and `../Card` modules respectively. These imports are likely used to define the types of the `items` and `background` props in the `CollectionCarouselProps` interface.
- `Breakpoint` is imported from the `@mui/material` module. This import is likely used to define the type of the `itemsWidth` prop in the `CollectionCarouselProps` interface.

Script Summary:
This script defines two interfaces: `CollectionCarouselProps` and `CollectionCarouselClasses`. The `CollectionCarouselProps` interface defines the props that can be passed to the CollectionCarousel component, while the `CollectionCarouselClasses` interface defines the CSS classes that can be applied to the component.

Internal Functions:
There are no internal functions defined in this script.

External Functions:

Interaction Summary:
This script does not directly interact with the rest of the application. It provides definitions that can be used by other components or modules that use the CollectionCarousel component.

Developer Questions:
- What are the possible values for the `variant` prop in the `CollectionCarouselProps` interface?
- How should the `sidekickLookup` prop be used in the CollectionCarousel component?
- How can I apply the CSS classes defined in the `CollectionCarouselClasses` interface to the CollectionCarousel component?
