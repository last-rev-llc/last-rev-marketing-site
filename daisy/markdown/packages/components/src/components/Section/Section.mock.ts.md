Summary:
This code file exports two functions, `singlePanelMock` and `splitPanelMock`, which are used to generate mock data for a specific type of section in a software application. The mock data generated by these functions is of type `SectionProps`, which is defined in another file. The `singlePanelMock` function generates mock data for a single-panel section, while the `splitPanelMock` function generates mock data for a split-panel section. The generated mock data includes various properties and styles that can be used to render the section.

Import statements:
- `SectionProps` is imported from the `Section` file, which is located in the same directory as this file. This import is used to define the type of the mock data generated by the functions.
- `mockTheme` is imported from the `theme` file, which is located in the parent directory. This import is not used in this file and may be unnecessary.
- `richTextMock` is imported from the `Text` file, which is located in the same directory as this file. This import is used to generate mock data for the content of the sections.

Script Summary:
This script exports two functions, `singlePanelMock` and `splitPanelMock`, which generate mock data for different types of sections in a software application. The generated mock data includes properties and styles that can be used to render the sections.

Internal Functions:
- `singlePanelMock`: This function generates mock data for a single-panel section. It returns an object of type `SectionProps` with the following properties:
  - `__typename`: A string indicating the type of the section.
  - `variant`: A string indicating the variant of the section (in this case, "single-panel").
  - `styles`: An object containing styles for the section. In this case, it only includes a `gridContainer` property with a `spacing` value of 4.
  - `contents`: An array of content items for the section. In this case, it contains a single item generated by the `richTextMock` function.

- `splitPanelMock`: This function generates mock data for a split-panel section. It returns an object of type `SectionProps` with the following properties:
  - `__typename`: A string indicating the type of the section.
  - `variant`: A string indicating the variant of the section (in this case, "split-panel").
  - `styles`: An object containing styles for the section. In this case, it only includes a `gridContainer` property with a `spacing` value of 4.
  - `contents`: An array of content items for the section. In this case, it contains two items: one generated by the `richTextMock` function, and another object representing a media item with a URL and dimensions.

External Functions:
- None

Interaction Summary:
This script is used to generate mock data for sections in a software application. The generated mock data can be used to render the sections and test the application's functionality. Other parts of the application can import and use the mock data generated by this script.

Developer Questions:
- How can I modify the generated mock data to include additional content items or different styles?
- Can I use this script to generate mock data for other types of sections?
- Are there any other dependencies or files that I need to be aware of when using this script?
- Is there any specific way to handle errors or edge cases when using the generated mock data?
