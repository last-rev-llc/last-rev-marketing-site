Summary:
This code is a TypeScript module that defines interfaces and types related to an image component. It exports an interface `ImageProps` that extends the `NextImageProps` interface from the `next/image` package. It also exports an interface `ImageClasses` and a constant `accordionClasses`. The purpose of this module is to provide a standardized way to define and handle image properties and styles within a software application.

Import statements:
- `import { ImageProps as NextImageProps } from 'next/image';`: This imports the `ImageProps` interface from the `next/image` package and renames it as `NextImageProps`. This allows the code to extend the `NextImageProps` interface with additional properties.

Script Summary:
The script defines two interfaces (`ImageProps` and `ImageClasses`) and a constant (`accordionClasses`). It also exports the `accordionClasses` constant as the default export of the module.

Internal Functions:
- None

External Functions:

Interaction Summary:
This module can be imported and used by other components or modules within the software application. It provides a standardized way to define image properties and styles, making it easier to handle and manipulate images throughout the application.
