Summary:
This code exports a default function that returns an object with properties for a filtered collection component. The purpose of this script is to provide a mock data object for testing or development purposes. It is a standalone file that can be imported and used in other parts of the application.

Import statements:
- `CollectionFilteredProps` is imported from the `@last-rev/component-library/dist/components/CollectionFiltered` module. This import is used to define the type of the returned object.
- `cardMock` is imported from the `../Card/Card.mock` module. This import is used to generate mock data for each item in the collection.
- `mockTheme` is imported from the `../../theme` module. This import is not used in the code and can be removed.

Script Summary:
The script exports a default function that returns an object with properties for a filtered collection component. The returned object has the following properties:
- `id`: A string value representing the ID of the collection component.
- `variant`: A string value representing the variant of the collection component.
- `itemsSpacing`: A number value representing the spacing between items in the collection.
- `items`: An array of objects representing the items in the collection. Each item is generated using the `cardMock` function and has an additional `title` property.
- `itemsVariant`: A string value representing the variant of the items in the collection.

Internal Functions:

Interaction Summary:
This script can be imported and used in other parts of the application to provide mock data for a filtered collection component. Developers can modify the returned object to customize the properties of the component, such as the ID, variant, spacing, and item data.

Developer Questions:
- How can I customize the properties of the returned object?
- Can I use a different mock data function instead of `cardMock`?
- What other properties can I add to the returned object to customize the component further?
