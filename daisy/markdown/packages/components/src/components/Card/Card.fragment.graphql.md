The purpose of this code is to define GraphQL fragments for a Card component in a software application. These fragments are used to specify the fields and data structure of the Card component when making GraphQL queries.

The code is structured as a multi-line string, which contains GraphQL queries and fragments. The fragments are defined using the "fragment" keyword, followed by a name and the fields that should be included in the fragment. The fragments are then referenced in other fragments or queries using the spread syntax ("...").

There are no import statements in this code, as it is a standalone script. However, in a larger application, import statements would be used to import necessary modules or libraries.

The code defines three fragments: "Card_FieldsFragment", "Card_BaseFragment", and "Card_RichTextFragment". Each fragment specifies the fields and data structure of a Card component.

The "Card_FieldsFragment" fragment includes fields such as "variant", "theme", "media", "title", "subtitle", "actions", and "link". Some of these fields are also defined as separate fragments, such as "Content_BaseFragment", "Media_BaseFragment", "Link_BaseFragment", and "Link_CardFragment". These separate fragments likely define additional fields and data structures specific to those components.

The "Card_BaseFragment" fragment extends the "Card_FieldsFragment" fragment and includes an additional field "body". The "body" field is defined as a separate fragment called "RichText_BaseFragment", which likely specifies the fields and data structure of a RichText component.

The "Card_RichTextFragment" fragment extends the "Card_FieldsFragment" fragment and includes the "body" field, which is defined as a separate fragment called "RichText_CardFragment". This fragment likely specifies the fields and data structure of a RichText component specific to a Card.

The code does not contain any loops or conditional statements. It is purely focused on defining GraphQL fragments.

In terms of variable usage, there are no variables used in this code. The fragments are static and do not depend on any dynamic values.

As this code is a standalone script, there are no known bugs or issues. However, if this code is part of a larger application, it is important to ensure that the fragments are used correctly in GraphQL queries and that the fields and data structures are consistent with the Card component's implementation.

In summary, this code defines GraphQL fragments for a Card component in a software application. The fragments specify the fields and data structure of the Card component, as well as any related components such as RichText, Content, Media, and Link. The code is structured as a multi-line string and does not contain any import statements, loops, or conditional statements. It is important to use these fragments correctly in GraphQL queries and ensure consistency with the Card component's implementation.
