Summary:
This code is a default export of an object that represents an accordion component. It sets various properties of the accordion, such as its type, variant, title, body content, and other related data. The purpose of this script is to provide a default configuration for the accordion component, which can be used as a starting point or fallback when creating instances of the accordion.

Import statements:
- `richTextMock` is imported from the `../Text/Text.mock` file. It is likely a mock implementation of a rich text component, used to provide sample content for the accordion's body.

Script Summary:
The script exports an object with various properties that define the configuration of an accordion component. These properties include:
- `__typename`: A string representing the type of the accordion, which is set to "Accordion".
- `variant`: A string representing the variant of the accordion, which is set to "accordion-standard".
- `title`: A string representing the title of the accordion, which is set to "Etiam habebis sem dicantur magna mollis euismod."
- `body`: The body content of the accordion, which is set to the result of calling the `richTextMock` function.
- `internalTitle`: A string representing an internal title for the accordion, which is set to "hola!".
- `sidekickLookup`: An empty object, indicating that there is no sidekick associated with the accordion.
- `children`: An empty array, indicating that the accordion has no child components.

Internal Functions:
None.

External Functions:
None.

Interaction Summary:
This script does not directly interact with other components or modules in the application. It simply exports a default configuration for the accordion component, which can be used by other parts of the application when creating instances of the accordion.

Developer Questions:
- How can I customize the variant of the accordion?
- Can I provide my own body content instead of using the `richTextMock` function?
- What other properties can I set for the accordion?
- How can I add child components to the accordion?
- How does the `sidekickLookup` property work?
