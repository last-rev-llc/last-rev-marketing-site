Summary:
This code file contains a series of mock data objects and functions related to media assets. These mock data objects are used for testing and development purposes, allowing developers to simulate media assets without relying on real data. The code includes mock data for images, videos, responsive media, SVGs, and external SVGs.

Import statements:
- `lorem` is imported from the `faker` library. This library generates random text, which is used to populate the mock data objects.
- `MediaProps` is imported from the `./Media` file. This import likely provides the type definition for the `MediaProps` object used in the code.

Script Summary:
The script defines several mock data objects and functions that generate these mock data objects. These objects represent different types of media assets and are used for testing and development purposes.

Internal Functions:
- `mediaMock`: This function generates a mock `MediaProps` object representing an image. It returns an object with properties for the file URL, width, height, title, and description. The file URL is a relative path to a JPEG image file.
- `mediaVideoMock`: This object represents a mock video media asset. It has properties for the ID, variant, title, file URL, and controls. The file URL points to a Vimeo video.
- `assetMock`: This function generates a mock `MediaProps` object representing a media asset. It returns an object with properties for the ID, file, title, and description. The file property is generated using the `fileMock` function.
- `fileMock`: This function generates a mock file object with properties for the URL, width, and height. The URL is a dynamically generated path that includes a timestamp and random words.
- `responsiveMediaMock`: This object represents a mock responsive media asset. It has properties for the ID, file, fileTablet, fileMobile, title, and description. The file properties represent different versions of the media asset for different devices.
- `SVGMediaMock`: This object represents a mock SVG media asset. It has properties for the ID, file, title, and description. The file property points to an SVG file.
- `ExternalSVGMediaMock`: This object represents a mock SVG media asset with the `disableInlineSVG` property set to true. It has properties for the ID, file, disableInlineSVG, title, and description.

External Functions:
None

Interaction Summary:
This code file provides mock data objects and functions that can be used by other parts of the application for testing and development purposes. Developers can import these mock data objects and use them to simulate media assets without relying on real data. The mock data objects cover various types of media assets, including images, videos, responsive media, SVGs, and external SVGs.

Developer Questions:
- How can I use these mock data objects in my tests or development code?
- Can I modify the mock data objects to fit my specific use case?
- Are there any limitations or known issues with these mock data objects?
- How can I generate additional mock data objects if needed?
