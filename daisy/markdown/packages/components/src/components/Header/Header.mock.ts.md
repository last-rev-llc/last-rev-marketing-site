Summary:
This code is a script that exports a function that returns an object representing the props for a header component. The header component is a part of a larger software application and is responsible for displaying a header section with a logo, navigation items, and optional actions.

Import statements:
- `HeaderProps` is imported from the `Header` module, which is likely a separate file containing the definition of the `HeaderProps` type.
- `collectionMock` is imported from the `Collection` module, which is likely a separate file containing a mock implementation of the `Collection` class or interface.
- `navigationItemMock` is imported from the `NavigationItem` module, which is likely a separate file containing a mock implementation of the `NavigationItem` class or interface.

Script Summary:
The script exports a default function that returns an object representing the props for a header component. The function does not take any parameters. Inside the function, a `collection` object is created using the `collectionMock` function. The `collection` object is then modified by adding three `navigationItem` objects to its `items` property. Finally, an object representing the header props is returned.

Internal Functions:
- None

External Functions:
- `collectionMock()`: This function likely returns a mock implementation of the `Collection` class or interface. It does not take any parameters and returns an object representing a collection.
- `navigationItemMock()`: This function likely returns a mock implementation of the `NavigationItem` class or interface. It does not take any parameters and returns an object representing a navigation item.

Interaction Summary:
This script is likely used as a configuration file for the header component. It exports a function that returns an object representing the props for the header component. Other parts of the application can import this script and use the returned object to configure the header component.

Developer Questions:
- What is the structure of the `HeaderProps` type?
- What is the purpose of the `collectionMock` and `navigationItemMock` functions?
- How can I modify the returned object to customize the header component?
- How does the header component interact with other parts of the application?
