Summary:
This code is a JavaScript module that exports an object containing various metadata values for a web page. These values include a title, keywords, canonical URL, description, and robots meta tag. The values are generated using the Faker library, which provides fake data for testing and development purposes.

Import statements:
- `import { lorem } from 'faker';`: This imports the `lorem` function from the `faker` library. The `lorem` function generates random lorem ipsum text.

Script Summary:
The script exports an object with properties for different metadata values. Each property has a `name` and `value` key. The `name` key specifies the name of the metadata field, and the `value` key contains the generated value for that field.

Internal Functions:
None

External Functions:
None

Interaction Summary:
This script can be used as a module in a larger application to generate fake metadata values for web pages. Other parts of the application can import this module and use the exported object to populate the metadata fields.

Developer Questions:
- How can I modify the generated metadata values?
- Can I add more metadata fields to the exported object?
- How can I use this module in my application to generate metadata for multiple pages?
