Summary:
This code is a module that exports a mapping of component names to their corresponding dynamic imports. It allows for lazy loading of components in a Next.js application. The purpose of this module is to provide a centralized location for importing and dynamically loading components, which helps improve performance by only loading components when they are needed.

Import statements:
- `dynamic` from 'next/dynamic': This is a function provided by the Next.js framework that allows for dynamic imports of components.

- `Section`, `Collection`, `PageBlog`: These are custom components defined in separate files.

- `Card`, `CollectionAccordion`, `NavigationBar`, `Media`, `Link`, `NavigationItem`, `Header`, `Hero`, `Text`, `Footer`, `BackToTop`, `TableOfContents`, `CollectionFiltered`, `CalendlyInlineWidget`, `Quote`, `Page`, `CollectionCarousel`, `Topic`: These are custom components defined in separate files.

Script Summary:
This script exports a mapping of component names to their corresponding dynamic imports. The `contentMapping` object is defined as a dictionary where the keys are component names and the values are the corresponding dynamic imports. This allows for easy access to the dynamically loaded components throughout the application.

Internal Functions:
None

External Functions:
None

Interaction Summary:
This module can be imported and used in other parts of the application to dynamically load components. By using the `contentMapping` object, developers can easily access and render the desired components without having to import them directly.

Developer Questions:
- How do I add a new component to the `contentMapping`?
- How do I use the dynamically loaded components in my code?
- How do I handle errors when dynamically loading components?
- How do I handle loading states when dynamically loading components?
- How do I handle server-side rendering with dynamically loaded components?
