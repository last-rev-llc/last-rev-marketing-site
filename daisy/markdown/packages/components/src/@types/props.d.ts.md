Developer Questions:
- How do I add a new component to the `ComponentsPropsList` interface?
- How do I import and use the props interfaces in other parts of the application?
- What happens if I don't declare the props interfaces for the components used in the application?
- Can I extend the props interfaces declared in this script to add additional props for specific use cases?
