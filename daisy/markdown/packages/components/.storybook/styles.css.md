This code appears to be a CSS script that is responsible for custom styling within Storybook components. Storybook is a development environment for UI components, where developers can build, test, and showcase their components in isolation.

The script starts with a comment block that provides a brief description of its purpose, which is to apply custom styling to specific elements within Storybook components.

The script then defines CSS rules using selectors and properties. Let's break down each section:

1. `#root .sidebar-header img`: This selector targets the `img` element within the `.sidebar-header` class, which is a child of an element with the `id` of `root`. The commented out line within this rule suggests that there was an attempt to apply a filter effect to the image, but it is currently disabled. The `height` property sets the height of the image to 40 pixels.

2. `.sidebar-header`: This selector targets elements with the class `.sidebar-header` and applies a background color of pink.

3. `.sbdocs h1, .sbdocs h2, .sbdocs h3, .sbdocs h4, .sbdocs h5, .sbdocs h6`: This selector targets heading elements (`h1` to `h6`) within elements with the class `.sbdocs`. It sets the `text-transform` property to `none`, which means the text will be displayed in its original case.

Overall, this script provides custom styling for specific elements within Storybook components, such as the sidebar header and headings within MDX documentation.
