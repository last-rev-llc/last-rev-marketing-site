Summary:
This code is a configuration file for webpack, a popular JavaScript module bundler. It defines the rules and plugins to be used when bundling the application's JavaScript and CSS files. The configuration includes rules for handling CSS files and JavaScript files using Babel. It also sets up aliases for certain dependencies and defines global variables using webpack plugins.

Import statements:
- `import path from 'path';`: This imports the `path` module from the Node.js standard library. It is used to manipulate file paths.
- `import webpack from 'webpack';`: This imports the `webpack` module, which is the main module for webpack.

Script Summary:
The script exports a JavaScript object that represents the webpack configuration. It has three main sections: `module`, `resolve`, and `plugins`. The `module` section defines the rules for handling different types of files. The `resolve` section configures how webpack resolves module imports. The `plugins` section adds additional functionality to the webpack build process.

Internal Functions:
- `toPath(_path)`: This is a helper function that takes a relative path and returns an absolute path by joining it with the current working directory. It is used to create aliases for certain dependencies.

External Functions:
None

Interaction Summary:
This configuration file is used by webpack to bundle the application's JavaScript and CSS files. It interacts with the rest of the application by defining how different types of files should be handled during the build process.
