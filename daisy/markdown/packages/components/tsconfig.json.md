Prompt: Explain the purpose and functionality of a configuration file in a larger application.

File Contents:
```
{
  "extends": "../../tsconfig.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "declaration": true,
    "outDir": "dist",
    "declarationDir": "dist",
    "module": "esnext",
    "target": "es5",
    "lib": ["es6", "dom", "es2016", "es2017"],
    "jsx": "react",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "noImplicitThis": true,
    "strictNullChecks": true
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "build", "src/**/*.stories.tsx", "src/**/*.test.tsx"]
}
```

Summary:
This configuration file is used in a larger application to specify various settings and options for the TypeScript compiler. It extends a base configuration file and overrides specific options as needed. The file includes compiler options, file inclusion patterns, and exclusion patterns.

Service:
The configuration file is specific to a TypeScript-based application. TypeScript is a programming language that is a superset of JavaScript, adding static typing and other features to improve developer productivity and code quality. It can be used to build web applications, server-side applications, and more.

Configuration Summary:
The configuration file extends a base configuration file (`tsconfig.json`) located two levels up in the directory hierarchy. It sets the output directory for compiled files to "dist" and the declaration directory to "dist". It specifies the module system to be used as "esnext" and the target JavaScript version as "es5". It includes several standard libraries for compilation and sets the JSX option to "react". It uses the "node" module resolution strategy and enables synthetic default imports and ES module interoperability. It also enables strict type checking and null checks.

Configuration Breakdown:
- `extends`: Specifies the path to the base configuration file to inherit settings from.
- `compilerOptions`: Contains various options for the TypeScript compiler.
  - `declaration`: Enables generation of declaration files (.d.ts) for TypeScript modules.
  - `outDir`: Specifies the output directory for compiled JavaScript files.
  - `declarationDir`: Specifies the output directory for declaration files.
  - `module`: Specifies the module system to be used.
  - `target`: Specifies the target JavaScript version.
  - `lib`: Specifies the standard libraries to include during compilation.
  - `jsx`: Specifies the JSX option for React.
  - `moduleResolution`: Specifies the module resolution strategy.
  - `allowSyntheticDefaultImports`: Enables synthetic default imports for modules.
  - `esModuleInterop`: Enables interoperability between CommonJS and ES modules.
  - `noImplicitAny`: Enables strict checking of implicit any types.
  - `noImplicitThis`: Enables strict checking of this usage.
  - `strictNullChecks`: Enables strict null checks.
- `include`: Specifies the file inclusion patterns using glob patterns.
- `exclude`: Specifies the file exclusion patterns using glob patterns.

Interaction Summary:
This configuration file interacts with the TypeScript compiler to control how the application's TypeScript code is compiled. It sets options related to module systems, target JavaScript version, JSX, module resolution, and more. The resulting compiled JavaScript files will be output to the specified directory. The inclusion and exclusion patterns determine which files are included or excluded from the compilation process.

Developer Questions:
1. How can I change the output directory for compiled files?
2. What is the purpose of the `extends` property and how does it work?
3. How can I add additional standard libraries to the compilation process?
4. What is the difference between `esModuleInterop` and `allowSyntheticDefaultImports`?
5. How can I change the target JavaScript version?
6. How can I exclude specific files or directories from the compilation process?
7. What is the purpose of the `declaration` option and when should I enable it?
8. How does the `moduleResolution` option affect module resolution in the application?
9. What are the implications of enabling strict null checks and strict type checking?
10. How can I configure the TypeScript compiler to work with a different module system, such as CommonJS?
