Summary:
This code snippet is a JavaScript module that exports a GraphQL endpoint URL. The purpose of this module is to provide the GraphQL endpoint URL for the application to interact with the GraphQL server. The script determines the GraphQL endpoint URL based on the environment variables and the deployment URL.

Import statements:
- None

Script Summary:
The script defines a constant variable `deployUrl` which is set to the value of the environment variable `DEPLOY_URL` or `VERCEL_URL`. These environment variables are typically supplied by the deployment platforms like Netlify or Vercel.

The script then defines a constant variable `graphqlEndpoint` which is set based on the value of the environment variable `STAGE` and the `deployUrl`. If the `STAGE` environment variable is set to 'build' or if the `deployUrl` is not available, the `graphqlEndpoint` is set to 'http://localhost:5000/graphql'. Otherwise, it is set to `${deployUrl}/api/graphql`.

Finally, the `graphqlEndpoint` is exported as the default value of the module.

Internal Functions:
- None

External Functions:
- None

Interaction Summary:
This module can be imported by other parts of the application to get the GraphQL endpoint URL. By using this exported value, other parts of the application can make GraphQL API requests to the server.

Developer Questions:
- How is the `deployUrl` determined and what are the possible values it can have?
- What is the purpose of the `STAGE` environment variable and how does it affect the `graphqlEndpoint`?
- How can I modify the GraphQL endpoint URL if needed?
- What happens if both `DEPLOY_URL` and `VERCEL_URL` environment variables are not available?
