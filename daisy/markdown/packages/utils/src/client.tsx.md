Summary:
This React file is responsible for creating and exporting an instance of the GraphQL SDK, which is used to interact with the GraphQL API of the larger application. It imports the `getSdk` function from the `@last-rev-marketing-site/graphql-sdk` package and the `GraphQLClient` class from the `graphql-request` package. It also imports the `graphqlEndpoint` from a local file.

Import statements:
- `getSdk` from `@last-rev-marketing-site/graphql-sdk`: This function is used to generate the SDK instance.

Interaction Summary:
This file is a client-side component that interacts with the GraphQL API of the larger application. It creates an instance of the GraphQL SDK using the `getSdk` function and the `GraphQLClient` class. The SDK instance can then be used to make GraphQL queries and mutations to the API.

Developer Questions:
- How can I use the `sdk` instance in other components to make GraphQL requests?
- How can I handle errors or network failures when using the `sdk` instance?
- How can I customize the GraphQL endpoint URL used by the `sdk` instance?
