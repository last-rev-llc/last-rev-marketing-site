Summary:
This code is a module that provides two functions: `isObject` and `merge`. The `isObject` function checks if a given item is an object. The `merge` function performs a deep merge of multiple objects into a target object.

Import statements:
There are no import statements in this code.

Script Summary:
This script exports two functions: `isObject` and `merge`. The `isObject` function checks if a given item is an object by checking its type and ensuring it is not an array. The `merge` function performs a deep merge of multiple objects into a target object.

Internal Functions:
1. `isObject(item: any): boolean`: This function takes an item as a parameter and checks if it is an object. It returns a boolean value indicating whether the item is an object or not.

2. `merge(target: any, ...sources: any[]): any`: This function takes a target object and multiple source objects as parameters. It recursively merges the source objects into the target object. It uses the `isObject` function to check if the target and source are objects. If they are, it iterates over the keys of the source object and merges them into the target object. If a key in the source object is also an object, it recursively merges the nested objects. The function returns the merged target object.

External Functions:
There are no external functions in this code.

Interaction Summary:
This script can be used as a utility module in other parts of the application. The `isObject` function can be used to check if a variable is an object before performing any operations on it. The `merge` function can be used to merge multiple objects into a single object, which can be useful for combining configurations or settings from different sources.

Developer Questions:
1. How do I use the `isObject` function?
2. How do I use the `merge` function?
3. What happens if one of the source objects is not an object?
4. Can I merge more than two objects using the `merge` function?
5. How does the `merge` function handle nested objects?
6. Can I modify the behavior of the `merge` function to handle arrays differently?
7. Are there any performance considerations when using the `merge` function with large objects?
