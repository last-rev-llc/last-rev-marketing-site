Script Summary:
The script exports a single function called "removeEmpty" that removes empty values from an object.

Internal Functions:
- removeEmpty(obj: Object): Object
  - This function takes an object as input and recursively removes empty values from it. It uses the Object.entries() method to convert the object into an array of key-value pairs. Then, it filters out the pairs where the value is null or undefined. For each remaining pair, it checks if the value is an object itself and recursively calls the removeEmpty function on it. Finally, it uses the Object.fromEntries() method to convert the filtered array back into an object.

External Functions:
- None

Interaction Summary:
This script can be used as a utility function to remove empty values from objects. It can be imported and used in other parts of the application where data cleaning or filtering is required.

Developer Questions:
- How does the removeEmpty function handle nested objects?
- What happens if the input object contains arrays or other non-object values?
- Can the removeEmpty function handle circular references in objects?
- Are there any performance considerations when using the removeEmpty function on large objects?
