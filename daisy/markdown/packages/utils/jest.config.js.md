   - To add more patterns to ignore, you can simply add them as strings to the "testPathIgnorePatterns" array.

2. How can I map additional file extensions to specific modules?
   - To map additional file extensions, you can add new key-value pairs to the "moduleNameMapper" object. The key should be a regular expression that matches the file extension, and the value should be the name of the module you want to map it to.
