Summary:
This script is a handler for a webhook in a broader software application. It receives an event object, which contains information about the webhook request, and processes it using the `handleWebhook` function. The script then returns a response object with a success or error message.

Import statements:
- `require('dotenv').config()`: This imports the `dotenv` package and calls its `config` function to load environment variables from a `.env` file.
- `const handleWebhook = require('@last-rev/contentful-webhook-handler')`: This imports the `handleWebhook` function from the `@last-rev/contentful-webhook-handler` package.
- `const config = require('../../../../lrconfig')`: This imports the `config` object from a file located at a relative path.

Script Summary:
The script exports a single function named `handler`. This function is an asynchronous function that takes an `event` object as a parameter. It tries to handle the webhook request by calling the `handleWebhook` function with the appropriate arguments. If the handling is successful, it returns a response object with a status code of 200 and a success message. If there is an error, it returns a response object with a status code of 400 and an error message.

Internal Functions:
- `handler`: This is the main function of the script. It takes an `event` object as a parameter and is marked as `async` to allow the use of `await` inside it. It calls the `handleWebhook` function with the `config` object, the parsed JSON body from the `event` object, and the headers from the `event` object. It then returns a response object based on the success or failure of the handling.

External Functions:
- `handleWebhook`: This function is imported from the `@last-rev/contentful-webhook-handler` package. It takes three parameters: a `config` object, a parsed JSON body, and headers. It handles the webhook request based on the provided configuration and returns a promise that resolves when the handling is complete.

Interaction Summary:
This script interacts with the `handleWebhook` function from the `@last-rev/contentful-webhook-handler` package. It also uses the `config` object from a separate file to configure the handling of the webhook request. The script receives an `event` object as input, which likely comes from an external source triggering the webhook.

Developer Questions:
- How is the `config` object used in the `handleWebhook` function?
- What are the possible values for the `contentStrategy` property in the `config` object?
- How can I modify the success and error messages returned by the `handler` function?
- How can I test this script locally without an actual webhook request?
