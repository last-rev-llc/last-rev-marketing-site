Summary:
This code is a script that is part of a broader software application. Its purpose is to handle caching during the build process. It has two main functions: `onPreBuild` and `onPostBuild`. The `onPreBuild` function checks if there is a cache available and restores it if found, while the `onPostBuild` function saves the cache for future builds.

Import statements:
- `const path = require('path')`: This imports the `path` module from the Node.js standard library. It is used to manipulate file paths.

Script Summary:
The script exports an object with two async functions: `onPreBuild` and `onPostBuild`. These functions are executed during the build process and handle caching.

Internal Functions:
- `getCacheDirs`: This function takes in the `constants` object and returns an array of cache directories. It uses the `path.normalize` function to normalize the path of the cache directory.

External Functions:
- `onPreBuild`: This async function takes in the `constants` and `utils` objects. It first calls the `getCacheDirs` function to get the cache directories. It then logs a message indicating the cache directories it is looking for. It uses the `utils.cache.restore` function to check if a cache is available and restores it if found. Finally, it logs a message indicating whether a cache was found or not.
- `onPostBuild`: This async function is similar to `onPreBuild`. It also takes in the `constants` and `utils` objects. It logs a message indicating that caching is in progress and the cache directories it is looking for. It uses the `utils.cache.save` function to save the cache. Finally, it logs a message indicating whether the cache was stored or not.

Interaction Summary:
This script interacts with the rest of the application by using the `constants` and `utils` objects passed as parameters to the `onPreBuild` and `onPostBuild` functions. It relies on the `constants` object to get the publish directory and uses the `utils` object to access the cache-related functions.

Developer Questions:
- How does the caching mechanism work?
- How can I modify the cache directories?
- What happens if the cache is not found or cannot be saved?
- How can I extend this script to perform additional tasks during the build process?
