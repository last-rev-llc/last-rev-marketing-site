Summary:
This code is a script that sets up and initializes the CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) middleware for a Next.js API route. The purpose of this script is to handle CORS-related functionality, allowing the API route to handle requests from different origins.

Import statements:
- `Cors` is imported from the 'cors' package. This package provides middleware for enabling CORS in Express.js applications.
- `NextApiRequest` and `NextApiResponse` are imported from the 'next' package. These types are used to define the request and response objects for Next.js API routes.

Script Summary:
The script defines a helper function called `initMiddleware` that takes a middleware function as a parameter. This function returns a new function that wraps the provided middleware function. The returned function takes the `req` (request) and `res` (response) objects as parameters and returns a Promise. Inside the Promise, the provided middleware function is called with the `req`, `res`, and a callback function. If the callback function is called with an instance of `Error`, the Promise is rejected with that error. Otherwise, the Promise is resolved with the result of the middleware function.

The script then initializes the CORS middleware by calling the `initMiddleware` function with the `Cors` middleware function as the parameter. The `Cors` function is configured with an options object that specifies the allowed HTTP methods as `GET`, `POST`, and `OPTIONS`.

Finally, the script exports the initialized CORS middleware as the default export.

Internal Functions:
- `initMiddleware`: This function takes a middleware function as a parameter and returns a new function that wraps the provided middleware function. The returned function takes the `req` (request) and `res` (response) objects as parameters and returns a Promise. Inside the Promise, the provided middleware function is called with the `req`, `res`, and a callback function. If the callback function is called with an instance of `Error`, the Promise is rejected with that error. Otherwise, the Promise is resolved with the result of the middleware function.

External Functions:
None

Interaction Summary:
This script is intended to be used as middleware for a Next.js API route. It can be imported and used in an API route file to enable CORS functionality. By using this script, the API route will be able to handle requests from different origins.

Developer Questions:
- How do I configure additional options for the CORS middleware?
- Can I use this script with other frameworks or libraries?
- How can I handle errors that occur in the middleware?
