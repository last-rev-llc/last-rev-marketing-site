Prompt: Explain the purpose and functionality of a configuration file in a larger application.

File Contents:
```

    "allowJs": true,

```

Summary:
This configuration file is used in a larger application to specify various settings and options for the TypeScript compiler. It includes compiler options, file inclusion and exclusion patterns, and other configuration parameters.

Service:
The configuration file is specific to the TypeScript compiler, which is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other features to enhance JavaScript development.

Configuration Summary:
The configuration file overrides the default settings of the TypeScript compiler. It specifies the target ECMAScript version, includes necessary libraries, enables JavaScript support, sets strict mode, configures module resolution, and defines the output directory.

Configuration Breakdown:
- `compilerOptions`: This section contains various options for the TypeScript compiler, such as the target ECMAScript version, supported libraries, JavaScript support, strict mode, module resolution, and more.
- `include`: This array specifies the files to be included in the compilation process. It uses glob patterns to match file paths.
- `exclude`: This array specifies the files to be excluded from the compilation process. It also uses glob patterns.

Interaction Summary:
The configuration file interacts with the TypeScript compiler by providing it with specific settings and options. These settings affect how the compiler transpiles TypeScript code into JavaScript. The specified options can impact the output code, its compatibility, and the overall behavior of the application.

Developer Questions:
1. What is the purpose of each compiler option specified in the `compilerOptions` section?
2. How do the inclusion and exclusion patterns in the `include` and `exclude` arrays work?
3. What is the significance of the `outDir` option and how does it affect the output of the compiler?
4. How does changing the `target` option impact the compatibility of the compiled code?
5. What is the role of the `baseUrl` option and how does it affect module resolution?
6. How does enabling the `resolveJsonModule` option affect the handling of JSON files in the compilation process?
7. What are the potential consequences of disabling the `strict` option?
8. How does the `incremental` option improve the compilation performance?
9. How can I add additional compiler options or modify existing ones to suit specific project requirements?
10. How can I configure the TypeScript compiler to generate source maps for easier debugging?
