Interaction Summary:
The `MyError` component is used as the error component in a Next.js application. When an error occurs, Next.js will call the `getInitialProps` function of this component to retrieve the error information. The `statusCode` is determined from the `res` or `err` objects in the `contextData`. If the `statusCode` is 404, a message is logged and the `statusCode` is returned. Otherwise, the error is captured using Sentry and the `getInitialProps` function of the `NextErrorComponent` is called.
