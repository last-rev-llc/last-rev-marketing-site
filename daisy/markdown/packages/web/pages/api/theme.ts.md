API Summary:
This code file contains an API endpoint handler for the `/api/theme` route. It handles incoming requests and returns the theme data from the `@last-rev-marketing-site/components/src/theme` module.

Import statements:
- `NextApiRequest` and `NextApiResponse` are imported from the 'next' package. These types define the request and response objects for Next.js API routes.
- `cors` is imported from the '../../src/cors' module. This function is used to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for the API endpoint.
- `Data` is a custom type that defines the shape of the response data.

Internal Functions:
- `themeHandler`: This is the main function that handles the API endpoint. It takes in a `NextApiRequest` object and a `NextApiResponse` object as parameters. It uses the `cors` function to handle CORS for the request. Then, it imports the `theme` object from the `@last-rev-marketing-site/components/src/theme` module. Finally, it sends a JSON response with the theme data.

External Services:
- The API endpoint interacts with the `@last-rev-marketing-site/components/src/theme` module to retrieve the theme data.

API Endpoints:
GET /api/theme
Summary: This endpoint returns the theme data from the `@last-rev-marketing-site/components/src/theme` module.

Example Usage:
```
curl -X GET \
  http://localhost:3000/api/theme \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'cache-control: no-cache' \
  -d '{
  "data": "data"
}'
```

Example Response:
```json
{
  "name": "theme name"
}
```

Interaction Summary:
When a GET request is made to the `/api/theme` endpoint, the `themeHandler` function is called. It handles CORS for the request and imports the theme data from the `@last-rev-marketing-site/components/src/theme` module. The theme data is then returned as a JSON response.

Developer Questions:
- How is the CORS handling implemented in the `cors` function?
- What other data is included in the `theme` object from the `@last-rev-marketing-site/components/src/theme` module?
- Are there any error handling mechanisms in place for this API endpoint?

TODO Items:
- Add error handling for the API endpoint.
- Document the expected structure of the `theme` object in the response.

Known Issues:
- None.
