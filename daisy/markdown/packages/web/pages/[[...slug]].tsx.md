Summary:
This file is a React component that is responsible for rendering a page in a larger application. It handles fetching data from a CMS (Contentful) and rendering the content using the ContentModule component from the Last Rev Component Library. The component is used for both server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side rendering.

Import statements:
- React: The main React library.
- join: A function from the 'path' module that is used to join multiple path segments into a single path.
- client, parseBooleanEnvVar: Utility functions from the '@last-rev-marketing-site/utils' module.
- ContentModuleProvider, ContentModule: Components from the '@last-rev/component-library/dist/components/ContentModule' module.
- contentMapping: A mapping of content types to React components from the '@last-rev-marketing-site/components/src/contentMapping' module.

Component:
The Page component is the main component exported from this file. It receives the 'pageData' prop, which contains the data fetched from the CMS for the current page. It renders the ContentModuleProvider component, which provides the contentMapping to the ContentModule component. The ContentModule component then renders the content based on the 'pageData.page' object.

Hooks:
None.

Event Handlers:
None.

Rendered components:
- ContentModuleProvider: Provides the contentMapping to the ContentModule component.
- ContentModule: Renders the content based on the 'pageData.page' object.

Interaction Summary:
This component interacts with other components in the application by fetching data from the CMS using the 'client' utility function. It then passes the fetched data to the ContentModule component for rendering. The ContentModule component uses the contentMapping to determine how to render each content type.

Developer Questions:
- How is the 'client' utility function implemented and what does it do?
- How is the 'contentMapping' object structured and how does it map content types to React components?
- How is the 'pageData.page' object structured and what properties does it have?
- How does the ContentModule component handle different content types and render them appropriately?
