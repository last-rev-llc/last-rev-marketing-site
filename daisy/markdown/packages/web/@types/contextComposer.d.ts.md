Summary:
This code is a module that is part of a larger software application. It is written in JavaScript and is used to create and manage a React context. The module provides a set of utility functions for composing multiple contexts together.

Import statements:
- `react-context-composer`: This is a module that provides the functionality for composing multiple React contexts together.

Script Summary:
This script exports a set of utility functions for composing React contexts. It defines a class called `ContextComposer` that has several static methods for composing contexts. It also exports a higher-order component called `withContext` that can be used to wrap a component with a context.

Internal Functions:
- `ContextComposer.compose`: This static method takes an array of contexts and returns a new context that combines all the values from the input contexts. It uses the `React.createContext` function to create a new context and the `React.createElement` function to wrap the input contexts with a provider component.
- `ContextComposer.composeMultiple`: This static method takes an array of arrays of contexts and returns a new context that combines all the values from the input contexts. It uses the `compose` method to compose each array of contexts and then composes the resulting contexts together.
- `ContextComposer.withContext`: This static method takes a context and returns a higher-order component that wraps a component with the context provider. It uses the `React.createElement` function to create a new component that renders the input component wrapped with the context provider.

External Functions:
- `compose`: This function takes an array of contexts and returns a new context that combines all the values from the input contexts. It is a wrapper around the `ContextComposer.compose` method.
- `composeMultiple`: This function takes an array of arrays of contexts and returns a new context that combines all the values from the input contexts. It is a wrapper around the `ContextComposer.composeMultiple` method.
- `withContext`: This function takes a context and returns a higher-order component that wraps a component with the context provider. It is a wrapper around the `ContextComposer.withContext` method.

Interaction Summary:
This module can be used in a React application to compose multiple contexts together. It provides utility functions for composing contexts and a higher-order component for wrapping components with a context provider. Other parts of the application can import and use these functions to create and manage contexts.

Developer Questions:
- How do I use the `compose` function to combine multiple contexts?
- How do I use the `composeMultiple` function to combine multiple arrays of contexts?
- How do I use the `withContext` function to wrap a component with a context provider?
- What happens if I pass an empty array to the `compose` or `composeMultiple` functions?
- Can I compose contexts that have different shapes or values?
