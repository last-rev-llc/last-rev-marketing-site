Summary:
This script is responsible for generating a sitemap for a website. It uses the Last Rev Sitemap Generator package to generate the sitemap based on the content stored in Contentful CMS. The generated sitemap is then saved in the "public" directory of the project.

Import statements:
- The "dotenv" package is imported to load environment variables from a .env file.
- The "generateSitemap" function is imported from the "@last-rev/sitemap-generator" package.
- The "resolve" function is imported from the "path" module.
- The "client" object is imported from the "@last-rev-marketing-site/utils" package.

Script Summary:
The script starts by loading environment variables from a .env file using the "dotenv" package. It then checks if the "CONTENTFUL_USE_PREVIEW" environment variable is set to true and assigns the result to the "usePreview" variable.

The script defines an asynchronous function named "run". Inside this function, it makes a request to the Contentful CMS using the "client.Sitemap" function from the "@last-rev-marketing-site/utils" package. The function takes an object with the root domain, locales, preview flag, and site name as parameters. The response data is stored in the "data" variable.

Next, the script calls the "generateSitemap" function from the "@last-rev/sitemap-generator" package. It passes the sitemap data and the path to the "public" directory as parameters. The sitemap is generated and saved in the specified directory.

The "run" function is then executed using the "run()" syntax. If any error occurs during the execution, it is caught and logged to the console. The process is exited with a non-zero status code. If the execution is successful, a success message is logged to the console and the process is exited with a zero status code.

Internal Functions:
- run(): This asynchronous function is responsible for generating the sitemap. It makes a request to the Contentful CMS to fetch the sitemap data and then calls the "generateSitemap" function to generate and save the sitemap.

External Functions:
- generateSitemap(data, outputPath): This function is imported from the "@last-rev/sitemap-generator" package. It takes the sitemap data and the output path as parameters and generates a sitemap file in the specified directory.

- resolve(...paths): This function is imported from the "path" module. It resolves the given paths into an absolute path.

- client.Sitemap(options): This function is imported from the "@last-rev-marketing-site/utils" package. It makes a request to the Contentful CMS to fetch the sitemap data. It takes an object with the root domain, locales, preview flag, and site name as parameters.

Interaction Summary:
This script interacts with the Contentful CMS to fetch the sitemap data. It also interacts with the file system to save the generated sitemap in the "public" directory.

Developer Questions:
- How can I modify the sitemap generation process?
- How can I change the output directory for the generated sitemap?
- How can I add support for multiple locales in the sitemap?
- How can I handle errors during the sitemap generation process?
