**Prompt:** Explain the purpose and functionality of a configuration file in a larger application.

**File Contents:**
```
{
  "extends": "../../tsconfig.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "outDir": "dist"
  },
  "include": ["./src/**/*"]
}
```

**Summary:**
This configuration file is used to specify the compiler options and file inclusion/exclusion settings for a TypeScript project. It extends a base configuration file (`tsconfig.json`) located two directories above and overrides specific options as needed.

**Service:**
The configuration file is specific to a TypeScript project, which is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. TypeScript provides additional features such as type checking, interfaces, and modules, making it easier to build and maintain large-scale applications.

**Configuration Summary:**
The configuration file extends a base configuration file (`tsconfig.json`) and overrides two compiler options: `baseUrl` and `outDir`. It also specifies the files to include in the compilation process using the `include` property.

**Configuration Breakdown:**
- `extends`: Specifies the path to the base configuration file (`../../tsconfig.json`), which is used as a starting point for this configuration.
- `compilerOptions`: Contains various options for the TypeScript compiler.
  - `baseUrl`: Sets the base URL for module resolution. In this case, it is set to the current directory (`.`).
  - `outDir`: Specifies the output directory for compiled JavaScript files. In this case, it is set to `dist`.
- `include`: Defines the files to include in the compilation process. It uses a glob pattern (`./src/**/*`) to match all files in the `src` directory and its subdirectories.

**Interaction Summary:**
This configuration file interacts with the TypeScript compiler to determine how the TypeScript code should be compiled. The specified compiler options affect the behavior of the compiler, such as module resolution and output directory. The `include` property determines which files should be included in the compilation process.

**Developer Questions:**
Developers working with this configuration file may have the following questions when debugging or changing this file:
1. What is the purpose of the `extends` property and how does it affect the configuration?
2. How does changing the `baseUrl` affect module resolution in the project?
3. What is the significance of the `outDir` property and how does it impact the output of the compilation process?
4. How does the `include` property determine which files are included in the compilation process?
5. Can additional compiler options be added to further customize the TypeScript compilation process?
