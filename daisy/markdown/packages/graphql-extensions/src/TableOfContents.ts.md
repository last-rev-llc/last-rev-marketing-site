Summary:
This code is a TypeScript module that defines the type definitions and mappers for a GraphQL schema. It exports the type definitions and mappers for the "TableOfContents" type, which includes a list of headings. The mappers are used to transform the data from the GraphQL server into the desired format.

Import statements:
- `gql` is imported from the `graphql-tag` library. It is used to define the GraphQL type definitions.
- `NonRelativeModuleNameResolutionCache` is imported from the `typescript` library. It is not used in this code and can be removed.

Script Summary:
The code defines the type definitions and mappers for the "TableOfContents" type in the GraphQL schema. The "TableOfContents" type has a field called "content" which is an array of "Heading" objects. The mappers are used to transform the data from the GraphQL server into the desired format.

Internal Functions:
- `content`: This function is a mapper for the "content" field of the "TableOfContents" type. It takes an item and a cache as parameters. It extracts the rich text content from the item, iterates over the nodes, and filters out the nodes that are headings. For each heading node, it extracts the level, text, and id, and adds them to the "headings" array. Finally, it returns the array of headings.

External Functions:
None.

Interaction Summary:
This code is part of a larger GraphQL schema and is used to define the type definitions and mappers for the "TableOfContents" type. Other parts of the application can use these type definitions and mappers to interact with the "TableOfContents" type in the GraphQL schema.

Developer Questions:
- How are the type definitions and mappers used in the rest of the application?
- How can I modify the type definitions or mappers to add new fields or change the behavior of existing fields?
- Are there any other types or mappers that need to be defined for other parts of the GraphQL schema?
