Summary:
This code defines a single function called createPath, which takes in a variable number of string arguments and returns a formatted path string. The function handles different cases for formatting the path, such as adding or removing slashes, and converting http to https. The code is exported as a default module.

Import statements:
There are no import statements in this code.

Script Summary:
The script defines a single function called createPath, which takes in a variable number of string arguments (slug) and returns a formatted path string. The function performs various checks and modifications on the input slug to ensure the resulting path is correctly formatted.

Internal Functions:
- createPath: This is the main function of the script. It takes in a variable number of string arguments (slug) and returns a formatted path string. The function first trims each segment of the slug and joins them with slashes. It then checks if the path starts with 'mailto://', 'http://', or 'https://', and returns the path as is in those cases. If the path starts with 'http://', it replaces it with 'https://'. The function then replaces any consecutive slashes with a single slash. If the path is not '/' and does not start with a slash, it adds a leading slash. If the path is not '/' and ends with a slash, it removes the trailing slash. Finally, it returns the formatted path.

External Functions:
- None

Interaction Summary:
This script can be used as a utility function to format paths in a broader software application. It can be imported and called from other modules to format paths based on specific requirements.

Developer Questions:
- How do I use the createPath function?
- What are the valid input formats for the slug argument?
- What is the expected output format of the createPath function?
- Are there any edge cases or special considerations to keep in mind when using this function?

Known Issues or Bugs:
- The code does not handle paths starting with 'https://' correctly. It assumes that any path starting with 'http://' should be converted to 'https://'. However, this may not always be the case. For example, 'http://example.com' should not be converted to 'https://example.com'. To fix this, the code should check if the path starts with 'https://' before attempting any modifications.

TODO Items:
- Use built-in path functions instead of manually manipulating the path string.
- Add unit tests to ensure the createPath function works correctly in different scenarios.
