Summary:
This code is a TypeScript module that exports a function called `createType`. The purpose of this function is to create an object with a specific structure that represents a content type in a broader software application. The function takes in a `type` parameter, which represents the content type, and a `content` parameter, which is an object containing the content data. The function then creates and returns an object with the required structure for the content type.

Import statements:
There are no import statements in this code.

Script Summary:
The script exports a single function called `createType`. This function takes in a `type` parameter, which is a string representing the content type, and a `content` parameter, which is an object containing the content data. The function then creates and returns an object with the required structure for the content type.

Internal Functions:
- `createType`: This is the main function of the script. It takes in a `type` parameter, which is a string representing the content type, and a `content` parameter, which is an object containing the content data. The function first creates an object with the structure `{ sys: { id: content?.id, contentType: { sys: { id: type } } }, fields: {} }`. It then iterates over the keys of the `content` object using `Object.keys(content)`. For each key, it adds a new key-value pair to the `fields` object with the key as the original key and the value as an object with the structure `{ 'en-US': content[key] }`. Finally, it returns the created object.

External Functions:
There are no external functions in this code.

Interaction Summary:
This script can be used as a utility function in a broader software application that deals with content management. It provides a convenient way to create content objects with a specific structure that represents different content types. Other parts of the application can call this function and pass in the necessary parameters to create content objects.

Developer Questions:
- How do I use this function to create a content object?
- What is the expected structure of the `content` object parameter?
- Can I modify the function to support additional languages or locales?
- How can I extend this function to handle more complex content types?
