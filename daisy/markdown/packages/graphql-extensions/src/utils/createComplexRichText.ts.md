Summary:
This code is a TypeScript module that exports a function called `createRichText`. The purpose of this function is to convert an array of `Item` objects into a rich text document object. The `Item` interface defines the structure of each item in the array, which can represent different types of content such as headings, paragraphs, hyperlinks, and text. The `createNode` function is a helper function used by `createRichText` to recursively create the nested structure of the rich text document.

Import statements:
There are no import statements in this code.

Script Summary:
The script defines two interfaces: `Mark` and `Item`. The `Mark` interface is a key-value pair where both the key and value are strings. The `Item` interface defines the structure of each item in the array that will be converted into a rich text document. It has properties such as `nodeType`, `value`, `data`, `marks`, and `content`. The script then defines two functions: `createNode` and `createRichText`. The `createNode` function takes an `Item` object as a parameter and recursively creates a nested structure of nodes based on the properties of the `Item` object. The `createRichText` function takes an array of `Item` objects as a parameter and returns a rich text document object with a `nodeType` of "document" and a nested structure of nodes created by calling the `createNode` function on each `Item` object in the array. Finally, the `createRichText` function is exported as the default export of the module.

Internal Functions:
- `createNode(item: Item): any`: This function takes an `Item` object as a parameter and returns a node object. The node object has properties such as `nodeType`, `value`, `data`, `marks`, and `content`. The `nodeType` property is set to the `nodeType` property of the `Item` object. The `value` property is set to the `value` property of the `Item` object. The `data` property is set to the `data` property of the `Item` object, or an empty object if it is undefined. The `marks` property is set to the `marks` property of the `Item` object, or an empty array if it is undefined. The `content` property is set to an array of node objects created by recursively calling the `createNode` function on each `Item` object in the `content` property of the `Item` object.

External Functions:
- `createRichText(items: Item[]): any`: This function takes an array of `Item` objects as a parameter and returns a rich text document object. The rich text document object has a `nodeType` of "document" and a nested structure of nodes created by calling the `createNode` function on each `Item` object in the array.

Interaction Summary:
This module can be imported and used by other parts of the application to convert an array of `Item` objects into a rich text document object. The `createRichText` function can be called with an array of `Item` objects as a parameter, and the returned rich text document object can be used for further processing or rendering.

Developer Questions:
- How do I use the `createRichText` function?
- What properties can an `Item` object have?
- Can I customize the structure of the rich text document object?
- How can I handle different types of content in the `Item` objects?
