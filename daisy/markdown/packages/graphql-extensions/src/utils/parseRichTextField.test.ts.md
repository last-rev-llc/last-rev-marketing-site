Summary:
The given code is a test script for the `parseRichTextField` function. It includes two test cases: one for when there is no content and one for when there is content. The script imports the `parseRichTextField` function from a local file, as well as a mock `richText` object and the `BLOCKS` constant from the `@contentful/rich-text-types` library. The script uses the `describe` and `it` functions from a testing framework to define and run the test cases.

Import statements:
- `parseRichTextField`: This is a function imported from a local file named `parseRichTextField.js`. It is used to parse a rich text field and return an array of parsed sections.
- `richText`: This is a mock object imported from a local file named `richText.mock.js`. It represents a rich text field with content.
- `BLOCKS`: This is a constant imported from the `@contentful/rich-text-types` library. It contains various block types used in rich text fields.

Script Summary:
The script defines two test cases using the `describe` and `it` functions. The first test case checks if the `parseRichTextField` function returns an empty array when there is no content. The second test case checks if the function works correctly when there is content in the `richText` object. The `parseRichTextField` function is called with the `richText` object and an options object that specifies the section delimiter as `BLOCKS.HEADING_2`. The test cases use the `expect` function to assert the expected output of the `parseRichTextField` function.

Internal Functions:
- None

External Functions:
- `describe`: This function is provided by a testing framework and is used to group and describe test cases. It takes a string description and a callback function as parameters.
- `it`: This function is provided by a testing framework and is used to define individual test cases. It takes a string description and a callback function as parameters.
- `expect`: This function is provided by a testing framework and is used to assert expected values. It takes a value as a parameter and returns an object with various assertion methods.

Interaction Summary:
The `parseRichTextField` function is likely part of a larger software application that deals with rich text fields. It can be used to parse the content of a rich text field and extract sections based on a specified delimiter. The parsed sections can then be used for further processing or display.
