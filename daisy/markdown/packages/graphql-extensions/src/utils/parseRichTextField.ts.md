Summary:
This code is a TypeScript module that provides functions for parsing rich text content from the Contentful CMS. It exports a function called `parseRichTextField` that takes a `Document` object representing rich text content and a configuration object, and returns an array of parsed content objects.

Import statements:
- `documentToPlainTextString` is imported from the `@contentful/rich-text-plain-text-renderer` package. It is used to convert rich text nodes to plain text strings.
- `Block`, `Inline`, `BLOCKS`, `Document`, and `Text` are imported from the `@contentful/rich-text-types` package. These types are used for type annotations in the code.

Script Summary:
The script defines several types and a configuration object. It then defines two functions: `parseNode` and `parseRichTextField`. The `parseNode` function is a recursive function that traverses a rich text node and its children, extracting content and section headings. The `parseRichTextField` function takes a `Document` object and a configuration object, and calls `parseNode` to parse the rich text content.

Internal Functions:
- `parseNode`: This function takes a rich text node, an array to store the parsed content, and a configuration object. It uses a stack to perform a depth-first search of the rich text node and its children. It checks the node type and extracts content or section headings accordingly. Parsed content objects are pushed to the results array.
- `parseRichTextField`: This function takes a `Document` object representing rich text content and a configuration object. It checks if the `Document` object is defined, and if so, calls `parseNode` to parse the rich text content. It returns the array of parsed content objects.

External Functions:
- `parseRichTextField`: This function is the main function exported by the module. It takes a `Document` object representing rich text content and a configuration object. It calls `parseNode` to parse the rich text content and returns the array of parsed content objects.

Interaction Summary:
This module can be used by other parts of the application to parse rich text content from the Contentful CMS. Developers can call the `parseRichTextField` function with a `Document` object and a configuration object to obtain an array of parsed content objects.

Developer Questions:
- How do I use the `parseRichTextField` function?
- What configuration options are available for parsing rich text content?
- How can I modify the parsing logic to handle additional node types?
- Are there any performance considerations when parsing large rich text documents?
- How can I handle nested sections or subsections in the parsed content?
