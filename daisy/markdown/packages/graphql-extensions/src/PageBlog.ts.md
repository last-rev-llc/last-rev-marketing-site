Summary:
This code is a script written in TypeScript that is part of a larger software application. Its purpose is to define and export various functions and variables related to the creation and manipulation of paths and content for a blog page. It also includes a GraphQL type definition and mappers for transforming data from a Contentful CMS.

Import statements:
- `gql` is imported from the `graphql-tag` package. It is used to define GraphQL type definitions.
- `getDefaultFieldValue`, `getLocalizedField`, and `createRichText` are imported from the `@last-rev/graphql-contentful-core` package. These functions are used to retrieve and manipulate data from a Contentful CMS.
- `ContentfulPathsGenerator` and `ApolloContext` are imported from the `@last-rev/types` package. These types are used as parameters in some functions.
- `Page` is imported from the `@last-rev/graphql-contentful-extensions` package. It provides mappers for transforming data related to a page.
- `getFirstOfArray` is imported from the `@last-rev/component-library/dist/utils/getFirstOfArray` package. It is a utility function for retrieving the first element of an array.
- `kebabCase` is imported from the `lodash/kebabCase` package. It is used to convert a string to kebab case.
- `createType` is imported from a local file `./utils/createType`. It is a function for creating a GraphQL type.

Script Structure:
The script starts with import statements, followed by the definition of some utility functions. Then, there is a GraphQL type definition using the `gql` function. After that, there is an object `mappers` that contains functions for transforming data from a Contentful CMS. Finally, there are two functions `pageBlog` and `pathsConfigs` that are used for generating paths and configurations related to the blog page.

Utility Functions:
- `mediaFieldResolver` is an async function that takes an object with `fields` and `ctx` properties as parameters. It retrieves and transforms data related to a media field.
- `getSeoValue` is a function that takes a `value` and a `defaultValue` as parameters. It returns the `value` if it is not empty or whitespace, otherwise it returns the `defaultValue`.
- `getSlug` is a function that takes a `topic` and `ctx` as parameters. It retrieves and transforms data related to a slug field.
- `formatBodyText` is a function that takes `body` and `length` as parameters. It formats the body text by removing unwanted elements, trimming it to the last punctuation, and adding an ellipsis if it is longer and ends with a space.
- `createPath` is a function that takes a variable number of `slug` strings as parameters. It joins the slugs with slashes, removes consecutive slashes, adds a leading slash if necessary, and removes a trailing slash if necessary. It returns the resulting path.

GraphQL Type Definition:
The `typeDefs` variable contains a GraphQL type definition using the `extend` keyword. It extends the `PageBlog` type and adds additional fields: `relatedLinks`, `featuredMedia`, `topics`, `header`, and `footer`.

Mappers:
The `mappers` object contains functions for transforming data from a Contentful CMS. It has two main keys: `PageBlog` and `Card`. Each key corresponds to a GraphQL type and contains functions for transforming specific fields of that type.

Interaction Summary:
This script interacts with a Contentful CMS by retrieving and transforming data from it. It also interacts with other parts of the application by exporting functions and variables that can be used elsewhere.

Developer Questions:
- How can I modify the behavior of the `mediaFieldResolver` function?
- What data does the `formatBodyText` function expect as input?
- How can I add additional fields to the GraphQL type definition?
- How can I modify the behavior of the mappers for the `PageBlog` and `Card` types?
- How can I use the `pageBlog` and `pathsConfigs` functions to generate paths and configurations for the blog page?
