Summary:
This code is a module that provides resolvers for the `href` and `target` fields of a `Link` type in a GraphQL schema. It also exports a `mappers` object that maps these resolvers to the corresponding fields in the schema. The module also extends the schema with additional fields for the `Link` type.

Import statements:
- `getLocalizedField` is imported from the `@last-rev/graphql-contentful-core` package. It is used to retrieve localized field values from a Contentful entry.
- `Mappers` and `ApolloContext` are imported from the `@last-rev/types` package. They are used to define the types of the `mappers` object and the context object passed to the resolvers.
- `gql` is imported from the `graphql-tag` package. It is used to define the GraphQL type definitions.
- `createPath` is imported from the `./utils/createPath` module. It is used to create a URL path based on a given input.
- `getPathReader` is imported from the `./utils/getPathReaders` module. It is used to retrieve a path reader object from the context.

Script Summary:
The script defines a `TARGET_MAPPING` object that maps target values to corresponding HTML target attributes. It then defines an `hrefUrlResolver` function that resolves the `href` field of a `Link` type. The function retrieves the localized `href` and `manualUrl` fields from the `item` object, and if either of them is present, it calls the `createPath` function to create a URL path. If neither `href` nor `manualUrl` is present, it retrieves the localized `linkedContent` field and loads the corresponding content entry. If the content entry is of type 'media', it retrieves the localized `asset` field and loads the corresponding asset entry. It then constructs a URL using the `file` field of the asset entry. Finally, it calls the `getPathReader` function to retrieve a path reader object from the context and uses it to get the paths associated with the content entry. If any paths are found, it returns the first path; otherwise, it returns '#'.

The script also defines a `targetResolver` function that resolves the `target` field of a `Link` type. The function retrieves the localized `target` field from the `link` object and maps it to the corresponding HTML target attribute using the `TARGET_MAPPING` object. If no mapping is found, it defaults to '_self'.

The script exports the `hrefUrlResolver` function as the default export and the `mappers` object and `typeDefs` as named exports.

Internal Functions:
- `hrefUrlResolver(item: any, _args: any, ctx: ApolloContext)`: This function resolves the `href` field of a `Link` type. It takes an `item` object representing the current link, `_args` representing any arguments passed to the resolver (not used in this case), and `ctx` representing the Apollo context. It retrieves the localized `href` and `manualUrl` fields from the `item` object and checks if either of them is present. If so, it calls the `createPath` function to create a URL path based on the value. If neither `href` nor `manualUrl` is present, it retrieves the localized `linkedContent` field and loads the corresponding content entry. If the content entry is of type 'media', it retrieves the localized `asset` field and loads the corresponding asset entry. It then constructs a URL using the `file` field of the asset entry. Finally, it calls the `getPathReader` function to retrieve a path reader object from the context and uses it to get the paths associated with the content entry. If any paths are found, it returns the first path; otherwise, it returns '#'.

- `targetResolver(link: any, _: never, ctx: ApolloContext)`: This function resolves the `target` field of a `Link` type. It takes a `link` object representing the current link, `_: never` representing any arguments passed to the resolver (not used in this case), and `ctx` representing the Apollo context. It retrieves the localized `target` field from the `link` object and maps it to the corresponding HTML target attribute using the `TARGET_MAPPING` object. If no mapping is found, it defaults to '_self'.

External Functions:
- None

Interaction Summary:
This module provides resolvers for the `href` and `target` fields of a `Link` type in a GraphQL schema. It can be used in a GraphQL server to handle queries and mutations related to links. The `mappers` object can be used to map these resolvers to the corresponding fields in the schema. The module also extends the schema with additional fields for the `Link` type.

Developer Questions:
- How can I use this module to handle queries and mutations related to links in my GraphQL server?
- How do I map the resolvers provided by this module to the corresponding fields in my GraphQL schema?
- How can I extend the schema with additional fields for the `Link` type using the `typeDefs` export?
- How can I customize the behavior of the `href` and `target` resolvers?
- Are there any known issues or bugs with this module that I should be aware of?
- Are there any TODO items or future improvements that need to be addressed in this module?
