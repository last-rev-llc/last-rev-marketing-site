Summary:
This code is a module that exports a constant object called "mappers". The purpose of this module is to provide mapping functions for the "RichText" data type. The "RichText" data type represents rich text content, such as formatted text with headings, links, and other elements. The module provides two mapping functions for the "RichText" data type: "json" and "links". These functions transform the raw data of a "RichText" object into a desired format.

Import statements:
- The code imports the "RichText" class from the "@last-rev/graphql-contentful-extensions" module. This module provides extensions for working with GraphQL and Contentful, a headless CMS.
- The code imports the "createHeadingId" function from the "./utils/createHeadingId" module. This function is used to generate unique IDs for heading elements in the rich text content.

Script Summary:
The script exports a constant object called "mappers". This object has a nested structure that mirrors the structure of the "RichText" data type. Inside the "RichText" object, there are two functions: "json" and "links". These functions are used to transform the raw data of a "RichText" object into a desired format.

Internal Functions:
- json: This function takes in four parameters: "raw" (the raw data of the "RichText" object), "args" (additional arguments), "ctx" (the context object), and "info" (information about the GraphQL query). It is an asynchronous function that returns a Promise. Inside the function, it first calls the "json" function of the "RichText" class to transform the raw data into a JSON object. Then, it iterates over the content nodes of the JSON object and checks if a node is a heading element. If it is, it generates a unique ID for the heading using the "createHeadingId" function and assigns it to the "id" property of the node's data object. Finally, it returns the modified JSON object.
- links: This function is similar to the "json" function, but it also retrieves assets and entries related to the "RichText" object. It takes in the same parameters as the "json" function and returns a Promise. Inside the function, it first calls the "links" function of the "RichText" class to retrieve the assets and entries. Then, it calls the "json" function to transform the raw data into a JSON object. It maps over the entries and checks if an entry is a table of contents. If it is, it assigns the JSON object to the "__richTextJson" property of the entry. Finally, it returns an object containing the assets and modified entries.

Interaction Summary:
This module provides mapping functions for the "RichText" data type, which can be used in other parts of the application to transform raw rich text data into a desired format. Other modules or components can import and use the "mappers" object to perform these transformations.

Developer Questions:
- How can I use the "mappers" object in my code to transform raw rich text data?
- What format does the "json" function expect the raw data to be in?
- How can I customize the mapping behavior for specific elements in the rich text content?
- How can I access the generated unique IDs for heading elements in the rich text content?
- How can I retrieve assets and entries related to the "RichText" object using the "links" function?
