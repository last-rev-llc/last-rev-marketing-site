Summary:
This code is a script that imports various modules and merges their type definitions, resolvers, mappers, type mappings, and path configurations. These merged values are then exported for use in a GraphQL application.

Import statements:
- `compact`, `map`, and `merge` are imported from the `lodash` library. These functions are used for manipulating arrays and objects.
- `mergeTypeDefs` and `mergeResolvers` are imported from the `@graphql-tools/merge` library. These functions are used for merging GraphQL type definitions and resolvers.
- `Source`, `DocumentNode`, and `GraphQLSchema` are imported from the `graphql` library. These types are used for working with GraphQL schemas.

The script starts by importing various modules that define GraphQL extensions. These modules include `Card`, `Collection`, `Header`, `Hero`, `Link`, `Media`, `NavigationItem`, `Page`, `RichText`, `Theme`, `Quote`, `Footer`, `LRSection`, `PageBlog`, `Section`, and `TableOfContents`. These modules likely define the type definitions, resolvers, mappers, type mappings, and path configurations for different GraphQL types.

The script then defines an array called `extensions` that contains all the imported modules.

The script exports the following variables:
- `typeDefs`: Merges the type definitions from all the extensions using the `mergeTypeDefs` function.
- `resolvers`: Merges the resolvers from all the extensions using the `mergeResolvers` function. The result is casted to `Record<string, any>`.
- `mappers`: Merges the mappers from all the extensions using the `merge` function.
- `typeMappings`: Merges the type mappings from all the extensions using the `merge` function.
- `pathsConfigs`: Merges the path configurations from all the extensions using the `merge` function.

Interaction Summary:
This script is likely used as a configuration file for a GraphQL application. It imports various modules that define GraphQL extensions and merges their type definitions, resolvers, mappers, type mappings, and path configurations. The merged values are then exported for use in the GraphQL application.

Developer Questions:
- How are the type definitions, resolvers, mappers, type mappings, and path configurations defined in the imported modules?
- How can I add or modify the type definitions, resolvers, mappers, type mappings, and path configurations in this script?
- How are the merged values used in the GraphQL application?
