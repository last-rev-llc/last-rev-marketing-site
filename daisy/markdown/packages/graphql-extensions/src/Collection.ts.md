Summary:
This code is a TypeScript module that defines the type definitions, resolvers, and mappers for a Collection in a GraphQL schema. It also includes utility functions for querying content from Contentful and manipulating strings. The module exports the type definitions, resolvers, and mappers for use in a larger GraphQL server.

Import statements:
- `getLocalizedField` from `@last-rev/graphql-contentful-core`: This function is used to retrieve a localized field value from a Contentful entry.
- `ApolloContext` from `@last-rev/types`: This type is used to define the context object passed to GraphQL resolvers.
- `gql` from `graphql-tag`: This function is used to define GraphQL type definitions.
- `camelCase` and `toUpper` from `lodash`: These functions are used to convert strings to camel case and uppercase, respectively.
- `collectOptions` from `./utils/collectOptions`: This function is used to collect options from Contentful entries.
- `queryContentful` from `@last-rev/graphql-contentful-extensions/dist/utils/queryContentful`: This function is used to query content from Contentful.

Script Summary:
The script defines the type definitions, resolvers, and mappers for a Collection in a GraphQL schema. It also includes utility functions for manipulating strings. The type definitions define the structure of a Collection and its related types. The resolvers define how to resolve fields in a Collection. The mappers define how to map Collection fields to actual data.

Internal Functions:
- `pascalCase`: This function takes a string and converts it to pascal case.
- `mappers`: This object defines the mappers for the Collection type. It includes functions for resolving the `items` and `itemsConnection` fields.
- `ITEM_MAPPING`: This object maps Contentful content types to Collection item types.
- `resolvers`: This object defines the resolvers for the CollectionItem type. It includes a function for resolving the `__resolveType` field.

External Functions:
- `typeDefs`: This variable defines the GraphQL type definitions for the Collection type and related types.
- `resolvers`: This variable defines the GraphQL resolvers for the CollectionItem type.

Interaction Summary:
This script is part of a larger GraphQL server. It defines the type definitions, resolvers, and mappers for a Collection in the schema. Other parts of the server can use these definitions and resolvers to handle Collection-related queries and mutations.

Developer Questions:
- How are the `items` and `itemsConnection` fields resolved in the Collection type?
- How are options collected for filtering Collection items?
- How are Collection items mapped to their respective types?
- How are Contentful entries queried and loaded?
