Summary:
This script is responsible for propagating a .envkey file to multiple packages within a software application. It uses the fs-extra library to read the contents of a directory and copy a file to specific locations. The script is structured as an async function that is executed when the script is run. It uses a try-catch block to handle any errors that may occur during the execution.

Import statements:
- `readdir` and `copyFile` from the `fs-extra` library: These functions are used to read the contents of a directory and copy a file, respectively.
- `resolve` and `join` from the `path` module: These functions are used to resolve and join file paths.

Script Summary:
The script starts by defining the paths to the .envkey file and the packages directory. It then reads the contents of the packages directory using the `readdir` function. The script then iterates over each package name and checks if it is not equal to '.DS_Store'. For each valid package name, it constructs the path to the .envkey file within that package and copies the .envkey file from the root directory to the package directory using the `copyFile` function.

If any errors occur during the execution, they are caught by the try-catch block and logged to the console.

After the execution of the main function, the script logs a success message and exits with a status code of 0 if everything was successful. If there was an error, it logs an error message and exits with a status code of 1.

Internal Functions:
- `run`: This is the main function of the script. It is an async function that reads the contents of the packages directory, iterates over each package name, and copies the .envkey file to the corresponding package directory. It returns a Promise that resolves when all the copying is done.

External Functions:
None

Interaction Summary:
This script interacts with the file system by reading the contents of a directory and copying files. It also interacts with the console by logging messages.

Developer Questions:
- How can I modify the script to exclude certain packages from the copying process?
- Can I change the name or location of the .envkey file?
- What happens if the packages directory does not exist?
- How can I handle errors during the copying process more gracefully?
- Can I add additional logic or processing to each package before or after the copying?
