Summary:
This script is responsible for generating code coverage reports for packages within a software application. It iterates over a specified folder, copies the coverage report files to a reports folder, and then merges and generates an HTML report using the nyc tool.

Import statements:
- `path`: This module provides utilities for working with file and directory paths.
- `fs`: This module provides an API for interacting with the file system.
- `child_process`: This module provides the ability to spawn child processes and execute commands.

Script Summary:
The script starts by defining some constants, including the starting path for the packages folder and the path for the reports folder. It then defines a helper function `execPromise` that wraps the `exec` function from the `child_process` module in a promise.

The script then defines an async IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) that serves as the main entry point. Within this function, it checks if the reports folder exists and creates it if it doesn't. It then reads the contents of the packages folder and initializes an empty array to store the report filenames.

Next, it iterates over each folder in the packages folder. For each folder, it constructs the path to the coverage report file, copies it to the reports folder with a modified filename, and adds the original filename to the reports array.

After that, it checks if the `.nyc_output` folder exists and creates it if it doesn't. It then executes three commands using the `execPromise` function: merging the reports, moving the merged report to the `.nyc_output` folder, and generating an HTML report using the merged report.

Internal Functions:
- `execPromise`: This function wraps the `exec` function from the `child_process` module in a promise. It takes a command as a parameter and returns a promise that resolves with the command's output or rejects with an error.

External Functions:
None

Interaction Summary:
This script interacts with the file system to read and write files, as well as execute commands using the `child_process` module. It also relies on the `nyc` tool for merging and generating code coverage reports.

Developer Questions:
- How can I modify the starting path for the packages folder?
- Can I change the output format of the code coverage report?
- What happens if a coverage report file cannot be copied or an error occurs during the execution of the commands?
- How can I customize the command execution or add additional commands?
