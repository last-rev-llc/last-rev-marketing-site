The purpose of this script is to start a development server for a software application. It is a bash script that sets environment variables, performs cleanup tasks, and starts the server.

The script begins with the shebang `#!/bin/bash`, which specifies that the script should be executed using the Bash shell.

The `set -a` command enables automatic exporting of all variables to the environment. This means that any variables defined in the script will be available to other processes.

The `source .envkey || echo "No .envkey file found"` line sources the `.envkey` file, which is used to set environment variables. If the file is not found, it prints a message indicating that the file was not found.

The `set +a` command disables automatic exporting of variables.

The `cleanup()` function is defined to perform cleanup tasks when the script exits. It is called using the `trap` command, which sets a command to be executed when the script receives a specific signal (in this case, the `EXIT` signal).

Inside the `cleanup()` function, the `rv` variable is set to the exit status of the script. Then, the `yarn gql:pm2:kill` command is executed to stop a GraphQL server. Finally, the script exits with the exit status stored in `rv`.

The `echo "Starting develop server..."` line prints a message indicating that the development server is starting.

The `yarn propagate:envkey` command is executed to propagate the environment variables defined in the `.envkey` file.

The next block of code checks the value of the `GRAPHQL_RUNNER_STRATEGY` environment variable. If it is set to "fs" or if it is empty, the script executes the `echo "Syncing CMS data..."` line and then runs the `turbo run sync:cms` command. This block is responsible for syncing CMS data if the strategy is set to "fs" or if the variable is not set.

Finally, the script executes the `turbo run dev --output-logs=new-only` command to start the development server with specific options.

Overall, this script sets environment variables, performs cleanup tasks, and starts a development server. It relies on the `.envkey` file for environment variable configuration and uses the `yarn` command to execute various tasks.

Import statements: There are no import statements in this script as it is a bash script and does not import external modules or libraries.

Classes and functions: There are no classes defined in this script. The `cleanup()` function is the only function defined, and it is responsible for performing cleanup tasks when the script exits.

Loops and conditional statements: The script uses a conditional statement to check the value of the `GRAPHQL_RUNNER_STRATEGY` environment variable. If the condition is true, it executes the code block inside the `if` statement.

Variable usage: The script uses several variables, including `rv`, which stores the exit status of the script, and `GRAPHQL_RUNNER_STRATEGY`, which stores the value of the corresponding environment variable.

Potential bugs or issues: 
1. The script assumes that the `.envkey` file is present in the current directory. If the file is not found, it prints a message but continues execution. It would be better to handle this error more gracefully, such as by exiting the script with an error message.
2. The script relies on the `yarn` command being available in the system. If `yarn` is not installed or not in the system's PATH, the script will fail. It would be helpful to check for the presence of `yarn` and provide instructions for installation if it is not found.
3. The script does not handle errors that may occur during the execution of the various commands. It would be beneficial to add error handling and logging to provide better feedback to the user in case of failures.

Summary: This script starts a development server for a software application. It sets environment variables, performs cleanup tasks, and executes various commands using the `yarn` command. The script could be improved by handling errors more gracefully and providing better feedback to the user. Additionally, it should check for the presence of `yarn` and provide instructions for installation if necessary.
