The purpose of this script is to build a software application using the yarn package manager and perform various cleanup tasks in case of failure. It is part of a broader software application and is responsible for the build process.

The script starts with a shebang line (`#!/bin/bash`) to specify that it should be executed using the Bash shell. The `set -a` command enables automatic exporting of all variables to the environment, and `source .envkey` attempts to load environment variables from a file named `.envkey`. If the file is not found, it prints a message but continues execution. The `set +a` command disables automatic exporting of variables.

The `cleanup` function is defined to handle cleanup tasks when the script exits. It first saves the return value of the script in the `rv` variable. Then, it executes a script named `post_build.sh` using the `bash` command. If the return value (`$rv`) is not equal to 0 (indicating failure), it prints a message and performs additional actions based on the value of the `NODE_ENV` environment variable. If `NODE_ENV` is set to "prod", it executes the `yarn pm2 logs` command to display logs from the `pm2` process manager.

The `trap "cleanup" EXIT` line sets up a trap to call the `cleanup` function when the script exits.

The `yarn propagate:envkey` command is executed to propagate the environment variables to the application.

The `bash "$PWD/scripts/pre_build.sh"` command executes a script named `pre_build.sh` using the `bash` command.

The script then prints a message indicating that the build process is starting.

The `STAGE=build yarn turbo:build --output-logs=new-only $1` command is executed to build the application. It sets the `STAGE` environment variable to "build" and runs the `turbo:build` script using `yarn`. The `--output-logs=new-only` flag specifies that only new logs should be displayed. The `$1` variable represents the first command-line argument passed to the script.

Overall, the script follows a sequential structure, executing various commands and scripts in a specific order. It handles cleanup tasks in case of failure and sets up environment variables before building the application.

Potential issues or bugs:
1. The script assumes that the `.envkey` file is located in the same directory as the script itself. If the file is located elsewhere, the sourcing of environment variables will fail. A solution could be to provide a configurable path for the `.envkey` file or handle the sourcing failure more gracefully.
2. The script does not handle errors or failures during the execution of the `propagate:envkey`, `pre_build.sh`, and `turbo:build` commands. It would be beneficial to add error handling and appropriate error messages in case any of these commands fail.
3. The script does not provide any mechanism for passing additional arguments to the `turbo:build` command. It could be useful to allow users to pass custom arguments to the build process.

Summary:
This script is responsible for building a software application using the yarn package manager. It sets up environment variables, executes pre-build and post-build scripts, and handles cleanup tasks in case of failure. It could be improved by handling errors more effectively, providing flexibility for the location of the `.envkey` file, and allowing custom arguments for the build process.
