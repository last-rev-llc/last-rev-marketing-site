**Summary:**
This configuration file is used in a larger application and defines various settings and dependencies for different stages of the application's pipeline. It includes information about the base branch, global dependencies, and specific configurations for different pipeline stages such as development, testing, building, and deployment.

**Service:**
The specific service or application that this configuration file is for is not mentioned in the provided file. However, based on the pipeline stages mentioned, it appears to be a web application with features like building, testing, linting, and deploying.

**Configuration Summary:**
The configuration file defines the base branch as "origin/main" and specifies global dependencies such as ".env" and "$TURBO_CACHE_KEY". It also includes configurations for different pipeline stages, including development, testing, building, and deployment. Some stages have additional dependencies and outputs specified, while others have cache settings defined.

**Configuration Breakdown:**
- `$schema`: Specifies the schema for the configuration file.
- `baseBranch`: Defines the base branch for the application.
- `globalDependencies`: Lists the global dependencies required for the application.
- `pipeline`: Contains configurations for different pipeline stages.
  - `dev`: Configuration for the development stage.
    - `dependsOn`: Specifies the dependencies for this stage.
    - `cache`: Indicates whether caching is enabled for this stage.
  - `storybook`: Configuration for the storybook stage.
    - `dependsOn`: Specifies the dependencies for this stage.
    - `cache`: Indicates whether caching is enabled for this stage.
  - `lint`: Configuration for the linting stage.
    - `outputs`: Specifies the outputs for this stage.
  - `test`: Configuration for the testing stage.
    - `dependsOn`: Specifies the dependencies for this stage.
    - `outputs`: Specifies the outputs for this stage.
  - Other stages like `test:e2e`, `test:watch`, `build`, `build-storybook`, etc., follow a similar structure with dependencies and outputs defined.
  - Some stages have specific dependencies from external services or modules, indicated by the "@" symbol followed by the service name and module name.
- Each stage's configuration can include settings for dependencies, caching, and outputs.

**Interaction Summary:**
This configuration file is used to define the behavior and dependencies of different stages in the application's pipeline. It allows developers to specify the order of execution, dependencies between stages, caching settings, and outputs for each stage. The configuration file interacts with other parts of the application by providing the necessary information for building, testing, and deploying the application.

**Developer Questions:**
1. What is the purpose of the `baseBranch` configuration and how does it affect the application?
2. How are the global dependencies specified in the `globalDependencies` section used in the application?
3. What is the significance of the `dependsOn` property in each stage's configuration?
4. How does the `cache` property affect the caching behavior for different stages?
5. What are the outputs specified for each stage and how are they used in the application?
6. How do the stages with external dependencies, indicated by the "@" symbol, integrate with the rest of the application?
7. Can additional stages be added to the pipeline and how would they be configured in this file?
8. How can the configuration file be modified to enable or disable caching for specific stages?
9. What is the purpose of the `$schema` property and how does it relate to the configuration file's structure?
10. How does this configuration file interact with other parts of the application's build, test, and deployment processes?
