The provided code is not a script but rather a configuration file containing environment variables. These variables are used to configure various aspects of the software application. The purpose of this configuration file is to provide a centralized location for storing and managing these variables, making it easier to modify or extend the application's behavior.

The structure of the code is a series of variable assignments, where each variable is assigned a value. The variables are named in uppercase letters and separated by underscores. The values assigned to the variables are specific to the environment in which the application is running.

Now let's go through each section of the code and explain the purpose of the variables:

1. BUILD ENV VARS:

   - CONTENTFUL_PREVIEW_TOKEN: Represents the access token for the Contentful preview API.
   - CONTENTFUL_DELIVERY_TOKEN: Represents the access token for the Contentful delivery API.
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTENTFUL_ENV: Represents the environment of the Contentful space (publicly accessible).
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID: Represents the ID of the Contentful space (publicly accessible).
   - CONTENTFUL_MAX_BATCH_SIZE: Represents the maximum batch size for Contentful API requests.

3. GRAPHQL:
   - GRAPHQL_SERVER_URL: Represents the URL of the GraphQL server.
   - GRAPHQL_SERVER_TIMEOUT: Represents the timeout duration for GraphQL server requests.

4. SENTRY:
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN: Represents the Data Source Name (DSN) for Sentry error tracking.
   - SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN: Represents the authentication token for Sentry.
   - SENTRY_URL: Represents the URL of the Sentry server.
   - SENTRY_ORG: Represents the organization name in Sentry.
   - SENTRY_PROJECT: Represents the project name in Sentry.

5. REDIS:
   - REDIS_HOST: Represents the host address of the Redis server.
   - REDIS_PASSWORD: Represents the password for the Redis server.
   - REDIS_PORT: Represents the port number of the Redis server.
