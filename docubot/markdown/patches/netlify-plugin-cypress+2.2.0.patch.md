Summary:
This file is a patch for the netlify-plugin-cypress package. It adds a new input field called "baseFolder" which allows users to change the base folder from which the Cypress commands are run. It also adds a new input field called "start" which specifies a command to run before testing. The file modifies the onPostBuild and onSuccess functions to include the new input fields.

Dependencies:
This file depends on the netlify-plugin-cypress package and its dependencies. It also uses the puppeteer and common-tags packages.

Code Summary:
The file adds two new input fields to the netlify-plugin-cypress package: "baseFolder" and "start". It modifies the onPostBuild and onSuccess functions to include these new input fields. The onPostBuild function now includes a "baseFolder" parameter which is passed to the runCypressTests function. The onSuccess function now includes a check for the "start" parameter and runs the specified command before testing. It also includes a check for the "baseFolder" parameter and changes the current working directory to the specified folder.

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the netlify-plugin-cypress package and its dependencies. It adds new functionality to the package by allowing users to specify a base folder and a command to run before testing. Other parts of the application that use the netlify-plugin-cypress package may need to be updated to include these new input fields.

Developer Questions:
- How does the "baseFolder" parameter affect the Cypress commands?
- What commands can be run using the "start" parameter?
- How does changing the current working directory affect the Cypress commands?
- Are there any other input fields that can be added to the netlify-plugin-cypress package?
- How can the onPostBuild and onSuccess functions be modified to include additional functionality?
