Summary:
This script is responsible for downloading the GraphQL schema from a server and saving it to a file. It uses the Rover tool to introspect the server and retrieve the schema.

Dependencies:
- yarn
- wait-on
- npx
- Rover

Code Summary:
1. Install Rover using yarn.
2. Set HEALTHCHECK to 1.
3. Use wait-on to check if the server is running and accessible.
4. If the server is not accessible, set HEALTHCHECK to 0.
5. If HEALTHCHECK is 0, skip schema download.
6. If HEALTHCHECK is 1, use Rover to introspect the server and retrieve the schema.
7. Save the schema to a file named schema.graphql.

Interaction Summary:
This script is likely part of a larger GraphQL application that requires access to the schema. The schema may be used for generating types, validating queries, and other GraphQL-related tasks. The script may be run as part of a build process or as a separate step.

Developer Questions:
- What is the purpose of the schema download?
- What is the expected location of the schema file?
- How is the schema file used in the rest of the application?
- What happens if the server is not accessible?
- How can I modify the script to use a different server or port?
