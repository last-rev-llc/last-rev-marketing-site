Summary:
This file exports an object with configuration options for the wait-on package, which is used to wait for a resource to become available before continuing with the application. The resource being waited for is the GraphQL server specified in the environment variable GRAPHQL_SERVER or the default URL of http://localhost:5000/graphql. The URL is modified to use the http-get protocol and a query is added to retrieve the schema types. The wait-on package will wait for the resource to become available and then continue with the application.

Import statements:
- require('dotenv'): loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env
- None
