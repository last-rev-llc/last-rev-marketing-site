Prompt: Explain the purpose and functionality of a configuration file in a larger application.

A configuration file in a larger application is used to store settings and parameters that control the behavior of the application. It is typically a plain text file that can be easily edited and modified by developers or system administrators. The configuration file is read by the application at startup and the settings are used to configure the application's behavior.

File Contents Summary:
The provided configuration file is used to generate a GraphQL schema file and includes the following settings:
- schema: the URL of the GraphQL server, with a default value of "http://localhost:5000/graphql"
- plugins: a list of plugins to use when generating the schema file, with a default value of "schema-ast"

Service:
The configuration file is specific to a GraphQL service, which is a type of API that allows clients to query and manipulate data using a strongly typed schema.

Configuration Summary:
The configuration file sets the URL of the GraphQL server and specifies which plugins to use when generating the schema file.

Configuration Breakdown:
- schema: the URL of the GraphQL server, with a default value of "http://localhost:5000/graphql". This setting determines where the schema file will be generated from.
- plugins: a list of plugins to use when generating the schema file, with a default value of "schema-ast". This setting determines which plugins will be used to generate the schema file.

Interaction Summary:
The configuration file interacts with the rest of the application by providing the necessary settings to generate the GraphQL schema file. The generated schema file is then used by the application to define the GraphQL API.

Developer Questions:
- What happens if the schema URL is incorrect or the server is down?
- What other plugins can be used to generate the schema file?
- How can I modify the default values for the schema URL and plugins?
