Summary:
This file contains a GraphQL query for retrieving a page based on its path, locale, preview status, and site. It includes a fragment called Content_PageFragment.

Dependencies:
This file depends on a GraphQL server to execute the query and return the requested data.

Code Summary:
The query is defined using the GraphQL syntax and includes variables for path, locale, preview, and site. It calls the page field and passes in the variables as arguments. The page field returns the data specified in the Content_PageFragment fragment.

Interaction Summary:
This file is likely used in conjunction with other GraphQL queries and mutations to retrieve and manipulate data in the application. It may be used to retrieve a specific page based on its path and other criteria, and the returned data can be used to render the page in the UI.

Developer Questions:
- What data is returned in the Content_PageFragment fragment?
- How is the data returned by this query used in the rest of the application?
- What happens if one of the variables passed to the query is null or undefined?
- How can this query be optimized for performance?
