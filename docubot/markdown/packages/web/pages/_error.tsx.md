Developer Questions:
- What is the purpose of the Sentry library and how is it used in this component?
- What is the difference between running on the server and running on the client, and how does this component handle errors differently in each case?
- What is the workaround for the issue with getInitialProps not being called in certain cases, and how does this component implement it?
