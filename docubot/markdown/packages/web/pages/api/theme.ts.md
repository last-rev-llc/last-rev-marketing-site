The following code is a Next.js API route handler that serves a JSON response containing the theme data for a website. The API endpoint is accessed via an HTTP GET request to the /api/theme route.

Import statements:
- NextApiRequest and NextApiResponse are imported from the 'next' package. They are used to define the types of the request and response objects that the API endpoint will receive and send.
- The cors middleware function is imported from a local file at '../../src/cors'. It is used to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for the API endpoint.

Internal Functions:
- themeHandler: This is the main function that handles the API request. It takes in a NextApiRequest object and a NextApiResponse object as parameters, and returns a Promise that resolves to void. The function first calls the cors middleware function to enable CORS for the API endpoint. It then imports the theme data from a local file at '@last-rev-marketing-site/components/src/theme', and sends a JSON response containing the theme data back to the client.

External Services:
- The API endpoint imports the theme data from a local file at '@last-rev-marketing-site/components/src/theme'. This file likely contains the color scheme, typography, and other design-related properties for the website.

API Endpoints:
GET /api/theme
Summary: Returns the theme data for the website.
Example Usage:
```
curl -X GET \
  http://localhost:3000/api/theme \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'cache-control: no-cache' \
```
Example Response:
```json
{
  "name": "My Website Theme",
  "colors": {
    "primary": "#0070f3",
    "secondary": "#ff0080"
  },
  "typography": {
    "fontFamily": "Roboto, sans-serif",
    "fontSize": "16px"
  }
}
```

Interaction Summary:
The API endpoint is accessed via an HTTP GET request to the /api/theme route. The endpoint first enables CORS using the cors middleware function, then imports the theme data from a local file, and finally sends a JSON response containing the theme data back to the client.

Developer Questions:
- What is the format of the theme data that is returned by the API endpoint?
- Where is the theme data stored and how is it updated?
- Are there any other API endpoints that interact with the theme data? If so, what are they and how do they work?
