API Summary:
This file contains an API endpoint that returns the theme data for the Last Rev Marketing website.

Import statements:
- NextApiRequest and NextApiResponse from 'next': These are types from the Next.js framework that define the request and response objects for the API endpoint.
- cors from '../../src/cors': This is a custom middleware function that adds CORS headers to the response.
