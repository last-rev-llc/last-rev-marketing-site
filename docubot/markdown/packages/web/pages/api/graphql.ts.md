This code file is an API route file for a Next.js application. It imports the necessary dependencies and middleware to handle incoming requests and then exports a single API endpoint handler function.

Import statements:
- `NextApiHandler`, `NextApiRequest`, `NextApiResponse` are imported from the `next` package to define the types for the API handler function parameters and return type.
- `Cors` is imported from the `cors` package to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for incoming requests.
- `createVercelHandler` is imported from an external package `@last-rev/graphql-contentful-core` to create a handler function for GraphQL queries.

Internal Functions:
- `initMiddleware` is a helper function that takes in a middleware function and returns a new function that can be used as middleware in the API handler function. It returns a Promise that resolves with the result of the middleware function.
- `cors` is a middleware function that uses the `Cors` package to handle CORS for incoming requests.
- `handler` is the main API endpoint handler function. It is an async function that takes in the `req` and `res` objects and first calls the `cors` middleware function to handle CORS. It then creates a new handler function using the `createVercelHandler` function from the external package. The `createVercelHandler` function takes in a configuration object that specifies the content strategy, cache strategy, and Apollo server options. It returns a new handler function that can handle GraphQL queries. The `handler` function then calls this new handler function with the `req` and `res` objects and returns the result.

External Services:
- This API endpoint works with a GraphQL server that is created using the `createVercelHandler` function from the external package `@last-rev/graphql-contentful-core`. The configuration object passed to this function specifies the content strategy, cache strategy, and Apollo server options.

API Endpoints:
- POST /api/graphql
Summary: This endpoint handles incoming GraphQL queries. It first calls the `cors` middleware function to handle CORS and then calls the `createVercelHandler` function to create a new handler function for the GraphQL query. It then calls this new handler function with the `req` and `res` objects and returns the result.
Example Usage:
```
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:3000/api/graphql \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'cache-control: no-cache' \
  -d '{
  "query": "query { posts { title } }"
}'
```
Example Response:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "posts": [
      {
        "title": "Post 1"
      },
      {
        "title": "Post 2"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Interaction Summary:
This API endpoint handles incoming GraphQL queries by calling the `createVercelHandler` function from an external package. It uses the `cors` middleware function to handle CORS for incoming requests.

Developer Questions:
- What is the `lrConfig` object and where is it defined?
- What is the purpose of the `createVercelHandler` function and how does it work?
- How can I modify the configuration object passed to the `createVercelHandler` function to change the content strategy, cache strategy, or Apollo server options?
- Are there any known issues or bugs with this API endpoint? 

TODO:
- Document the `lrConfig` object and where it is defined.
- Add more detailed documentation for the `createVercelHandler` function and how it works.
- Document how to modify the configuration object passed to the `createVercelHandler` function.
- Identify and document any known issues or bugs with this API endpoint.
