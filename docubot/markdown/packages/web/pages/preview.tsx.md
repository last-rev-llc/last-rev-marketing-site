Summary:
This file is a React component that displays a preview of content from a Contentful CMS. It uses the Last Rev GraphQL SDK to fetch the content and the Content Preview component from the Last Rev Component Library to display it. It also allows for overriding of content values and refreshing of the preview.

Import statements:
- React: the main React library
- getSdk: a function from the Last Rev GraphQL SDK that generates a set of functions for interacting with the CMS
- GraphQLClient: a class from the graphql-request library for making GraphQL requests
- useRouter: a hook from the Next.js library for accessing the router object
- ContentPreview: a component from the Last Rev Component Library for displaying content previews
- contentMapping: an object that maps Contentful content types to React components
- useSWR: a hook from the SWR library for data fetching and caching
- ContentModuleProvider: a component from the Last Rev Component Library for providing context to child components

Component:
The Preview component is a functional component that takes no props. It uses the useRouter hook to get the query parameters from the URL, including the environment, content ID, and locale. It then uses the useSWR hook to fetch the content preview data from the CMS using the getSdk function from the Last Rev GraphQL SDK. If there is no error and no data yet, it displays a loading state. It also listens for messages from the parent window to override content values or refresh the preview. Finally, it renders the ContentPreview component from the Last Rev Component Library, passing in the content data, override data, and other props.

Hooks:
- useRouter: a hook from the Next.js library for accessing the router object
- useSWR: a hook from the SWR library for data fetching and caching
- React.useState: a hook from the React library for managing state
- React.useLayoutEffect: a hook from the React library for running side effects after rendering

Event Handlers:
- window.addEventListener('message'): listens for messages from the parent window and updates the component state accordingly

Rendered components:
- ContentModuleProvider: a component from the Last Rev Component Library for providing context to child components
- ContentPreview: a component from the Last Rev Component Library for displaying content previews

Interaction Summary:
