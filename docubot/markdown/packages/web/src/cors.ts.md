Summary:
This file exports a middleware function that initializes the CORS middleware with specific options. It also includes a helper function to handle errors in middleware.

Import statements:
- Cors: a third-party middleware library for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in Node.js.
- NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse: interfaces from the Next.js framework for handling API requests and responses.

Script Summary:
The script exports a middleware function that initializes the CORS middleware with specific options. The options include only allowing requests with GET, POST, and OPTIONS methods. The initMiddleware function is a helper function that returns a Promise to wait for a middleware to execute before continuing and to throw an error when an error happens in a middleware.

Internal Functions:
- initMiddleware(middleware: any): a helper function that takes in a middleware function and returns a function that returns a Promise. The returned function takes in a NextApiRequest and NextApiResponse and executes the middleware function with these parameters. If the middleware function returns an Error, the Promise is rejected with the Error. Otherwise, the Promise is resolved with the result of the middleware function.

External Functions:
- default: exports the cors middleware function initialized with specific options.

Interaction Summary:
This file is a middleware function that can be used in the Next.js API routes to handle CORS. It can be imported and used in any API route that requires CORS handling.

Developer Questions:

- How can I use this middleware function in my API route?
- How can I handle errors in middleware using the initMiddleware function?
