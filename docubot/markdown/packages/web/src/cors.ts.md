Summary:
This file contains code for initializing and configuring the CORS middleware for the web application.

Import statements:
- Cors: a third-party middleware library for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in Node.js
- NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse: interfaces from the Next.js framework for handling HTTP requests and responses

Script Summary:
- The initMiddleware function is a helper method that returns a Promise to wait for a middleware to execute before continuing and to throw an error when an error happens in a middleware.
- The cors constant initializes the CORS middleware with the options to only allow requests with GET, POST, and OPTIONS methods.

Internal Functions:
- initMiddleware(middleware: any): a function that takes a middleware as a parameter and returns a function that takes in a NextApiRequest and NextApiResponse and returns a Promise. The Promise resolves with the result of the middleware or rejects with an error if the middleware throws an error.

External Functions:
- default: exports the cors constant, which is the initialized CORS middleware.

Interaction Summary:
- This file interacts with the rest of the web application by providing the CORS middleware for handling cross-origin requests. Other parts of the application can import and use this middleware to handle CORS.

Developer Questions:
- What other middleware is being used in the application and how do they interact with the CORS middleware?
- How are the CORS options configured for different parts of the application?
- What are the potential security risks associated with CORS and how is the application mitigating them?
