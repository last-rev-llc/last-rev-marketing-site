Summary:
This configuration file sets up the Cypress testing framework for the web package of the application.

Service:
Cypress is a JavaScript-based end-to-end testing framework that allows developers to write and run tests for web applications.

Configuration Summary:
This configuration file sets up the viewport width and height, the folder where integration tests are stored, the location of the plugins and support files, and the number of retries for failed tests.

Configuration Breakdown:
- viewportWidth: sets the width of the browser viewport for testing
- viewportHeight: sets the height of the browser viewport for testing
- integrationFolder: specifies the folder where integration tests are stored
- pluginsFile: specifies the location of the plugins file, which allows developers to extend Cypress with custom functionality
- supportFile: specifies the location of the support file, which allows developers to write reusable code that can be used across multiple tests
- retries: sets the number of retries for failed tests, with separate settings for run mode (when running all tests) and open mode (when running a single test)

Interaction Summary:
This configuration file sets up the Cypress testing framework for the web package of the application. Developers can use this file to customize the behavior of Cypress for their specific testing needs.

Developer Questions:
- How do I add custom plugins to Cypress?
- How do I write reusable code in the support file?
- How do I run tests in different viewport sizes?
- How do I debug failed tests with retries enabled?
