Summary:
This file is a configuration file for depcheck, a tool that checks for unused dependencies in a project. It specifies which dependencies to ignore during the check.

Dependencies:
This file does not have any dependencies.

Code Summary:
The file specifies two dependencies, "@last-rev-marketing-site/graphql-extensions" and "@last-rev-marketing-site/graphql-runner", that should be ignored during depcheck. These dependencies are needed for the lerna build order when running "yarn dev".

Interaction Summary:
This file does not directly interact with the rest of the application, but it affects the build order when running "yarn dev". By ignoring these two dependencies during depcheck, the build process can proceed without errors.

Developer Questions:
- What is depcheck and how does it work?
- What other configuration files are used in the project?
- What happens if we remove the ignored dependencies from this file?
