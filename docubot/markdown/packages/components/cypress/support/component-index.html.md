## Description
This is a basic HTML file with a meta tag and a div element. The meta tag sets the character encoding to utf-8 and specifies the compatibility mode for Internet Explorer. The viewport meta tag sets the width of the page to the device width and sets the initial scale to 1.0. The div element has a data-cy-root attribute, which may be used for testing purposes.
