Summary:
This file exports an object that contains presets, plugins, and configuration options for Babel, a JavaScript compiler that transforms modern JavaScript code into a format that is compatible with older browsers.

Script Summary:
The module.exports object contains the following properties:
- presets: an array of Babel presets, including @babel/env, @babel/preset-typescript, and @babel/preset-react.

- exclude: a regular expression that specifies which files should be excluded from Babel compilation (in this case, all files in the node_modules directory).
