Summary:
This file contains two GraphQL fragments, Link_BaseFragment and Link_CardFragment, that define the fields for a Link component.

Dependencies:
This file depends on the Content_BaseFragment fragment, which is defined in another file.

Code Summary:
The Link_BaseFragment and Link_CardFragment fragments both define the same fields for a Link component: text, href, variant, icon, iconPosition, and color. They also both include the Content_BaseFragment fragment.

Interaction Summary:
This file is used to define the fields for a Link component in the larger application. Other components or pages that use the Link component will use these fragments to query for the necessary data.

Developer Questions:
- What other components or pages use the Link component?
- Are there any other GraphQL fragments or queries that depend on these fragments?
- How can I add or remove fields from the Link component?
