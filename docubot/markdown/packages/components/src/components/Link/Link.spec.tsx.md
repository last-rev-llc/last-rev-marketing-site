Summary:
This file is a test suite for the `Link` component in a React application. The `Link` component can render as a basic link, a button, or a button with different styles (contained, outlined, or text). The component can also have different alignments, underlines, and icons.

Import statements:
- React: The library used to create the component.
- lodash: A utility library used for the `capitalize` function.
- NextRouter: A library used for handling routing in Next.js applications.
- mount: A custom Cypress command used for mounting the component in the test environment.
- Link: The component being tested.
- LinkProps: The type definition for the props of the `Link` component.
- mockContent: A mock object used for testing the `Link` component.

Component:
- Link: A versatile component that can render as a basic link or a button with different styles, alignments, underlines, and icons.

Hooks:
- beforeEach: Sets up the test environment by stubbing the NextRouter and initializing the mockedContent.

Event Handlers:
- None

Rendered components:
- Link: The component being tested, rendered with different combinations of props.

Interaction Summary:
The file tests the `Link` component in isolation, ensuring it renders correctly with different combinations of props. It does not interact with other components in the application.

Developer Questions:
- How does the `Link` component handle different combinations of props?
- How does the `Link` component interact with the NextRouter?
- Are there any edge cases that have not been tested for the `Link` component?

Known Issues/Bugs:
- None

Todo:
- Add more test cases for edge cases, if any.
- Test the component's interaction with other components in the application.
