Summary:
This file contains GraphQL fragments for the ContentModule component, which is a reusable component used throughout the application to display various types of content. The fragments define the data fields needed for different types of content, such as text, media, and cards.

Dependencies:
This file depends on other GraphQL fragments defined in other files, such as Card_BaseFragment and Text_BaseFragment.

Code Summary:
The file defines three GraphQL fragments: ContentModule_BaseFragment, ContentModule_SectionFragment, and ContentModule_RichTextFragment. Each fragment includes a list of other fragments that define the data fields needed for different types of content.

Interaction Summary:
This file is used by the ContentModule component to fetch data from the server. When the component is rendered, it sends a GraphQL query to the server that includes one of the fragments defined in this file. The server responds with the requested data, which is then used to render the component.

Developer Questions:
- What other GraphQL fragments are used in this application?
- How do I add a new data field to one of the fragments?
- How do I test changes to the GraphQL queries used by the ContentModule component?
