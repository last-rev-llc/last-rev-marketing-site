Internal Functions:
- `mediaMock()`: returns an object with fake data for a media component, including a file object with a URL, width, and height, as well as a title and description.
- `mediaVideoMock`: returns an object with fake data for a video component, including a file object with a URL and a `controls` property.
- `assetMock()`: returns an object with fake data for an asset component, including a file object with a URL, width, and height, as well as a title and description.
- `fileMock()`: returns an object with fake data for a file, including a URL, width, and height.
- `responsiveMediaMock`: returns an object with fake data for a responsive media component, including file objects with URLs, widths, and heights for desktop, tablet, and mobile, as well as a title and description.
- `SVGMediaMock`: returns an object with fake data for an SVG component, including a file object with a URL, width, and height, as well as a title and description.

Interaction Summary:
This file does not interact with the rest of the application directly, but the mock data it exports may be used in other components for testing and development.

Developer Questions:
- What is the purpose of each mock data object?
- How can I use these mock data objects in my tests?
- Are there any other mock data objects I should be aware of in the application?
- How can I modify these mock data objects to fit my specific use case?
- Are there any known issues or bugs with these mock data objects?
