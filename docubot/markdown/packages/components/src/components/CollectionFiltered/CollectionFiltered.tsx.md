Summary:
This file exports a Higher Order Component (HOC) called `withFetchItems` that wraps the `CollectionFiltered` component from a third-party library. The `withFetchItems` HOC adds a `fetchItems` function as a prop to the `CollectionFiltered` component, which is used to fetch items from a server. 

Import statements:
- `React` is imported from the `react` library.
- `CollectionFiltered` and related types are imported from a third-party library called `@last-rev/component-library`.
- `preview` is a boolean variable that is set to `true` if the `CONTENTFUL_USE_PREVIEW` environment variable is truthy.
- `withFetchItems` uses dynamic imports to load a `client` function from a utility module called `@last-rev-marketing-site/utils`.

Component:
- `withFetchItems` is a Higher Order Component that takes a component as an argument and returns a new component with additional functionality. In this case, it adds a `fetchItems` function as a prop to the wrapped component.

Hooks:
- None

Event Handlers:
- None

Rendered components:
- `Wrapped` is the component that is passed as an argument to `withFetchItems`. It is rendered with the `fetchItems` prop and other props passed down from the parent component.

Interaction Summary:
This file is a client-side component that interacts with a server to fetch items for display in the `CollectionFiltered` component. It uses a third-party library for the `CollectionFiltered` component and a utility module for the `client` function. The `fetchItems` function is used to fetch items from the server based on filter criteria, and the results are passed down to the `CollectionFiltered` component for display.

Developer Questions:
- What is the structure of the data returned by the server in the `data` object?
- How is the `client` function implemented in the `@last-rev-marketing-site/utils` module?
- What other components use the `CollectionFiltered` component, and how are they configured?
