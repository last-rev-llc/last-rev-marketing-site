Summary:
This file exports two functions, `mockWithNavigationItems` and a default function. Both functions return an object with properties that are used to render a NavigationBar component.

Import statements:
- `mockNavigationItem` from `../NavigationItem/NavigationItem.mock`: This is a mock function that returns an object with properties that are used to render a NavigationItem component.
- `NavigationProps` from `./NavigationBar`: This is an interface that defines the props that are passed to the NavigationBar component.
- `mockLink` from `../Link/Link.mock`: This is a mock function that returns an object with properties that are used to render a Link component.
- `mockTheme` from `../../theme`: This is a mock object that is used to provide a theme to the NavigationBar component.

Script Summary:
This file exports two functions:
- `mockWithNavigationItems`: This function returns an object with properties that are used to render a NavigationBar component with four NavigationItem components.
- Default function: This function returns an object with properties that are used to render a NavigationBar component with four Link components.

Internal Functions:
- `mockWithNavigationItems`: This function returns an object with the following properties:
  - `variant`: A string that specifies the variant of the NavigationBar component.
  - `items`: An array of four objects that are used to render NavigationItem components.
  - `itemsVariant`: A string that specifies the variant of the NavigationItem components.
  - `sidekickLookup`: A string that specifies the sidekick lookup value for the NavigationBar component.

External Functions:
- Default function: This function returns an object with the following properties:
  - `variant`: A string that specifies the variant of the NavigationBar component.
  - `items`: An array of four objects that are used to render Link components.
  - `itemsVariant`: A string that specifies the variant of the Link components.
  - `sidekickLookup`: A string that specifies the sidekick lookup value for the NavigationBar component.

Interaction Summary:
This file exports functions that are used to render a NavigationBar component. The NavigationBar component may interact with other components in the application, such as the Link and NavigationItem components.

Developer Questions:
- What is the purpose of the `mockTheme` import?
- What is the significance of the `sidekickLookup` property?
- How can I customize the NavigationBar component using these functions?
- Are there any other mock functions that are used in this application?
- How can I test the NavigationBar component using these functions?
- Are there any known issues or bugs with the NavigationBar component that I should be aware of?
- What are the next steps for implementing the NavigationBar component in the application?
