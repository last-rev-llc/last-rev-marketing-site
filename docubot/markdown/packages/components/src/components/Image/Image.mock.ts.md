Summary:
This file exports a default function that returns an object with properties for an image component. It imports the `lorem` function from the `faker` library and the `ImageProps` interface from the `Image.types` file.

Import statements:
- `lorem` from `faker`: a library for generating random data
- `ImageProps` from `./Image.types`: an interface for the props of an image component

Script Summary:
The default function returns an object with the following properties:
- `src`: a URL for the image
- `alt`: a string of three random words generated by the `lorem` function
- `width`: a number for the width of the image
- `height`: a number for the height of the image
- `className`: a string of a random word generated by the `lorem` function
- `testId`: a string of "Image"
- `lazy`: a boolean value for whether or not the image should be lazy loaded (currently commented out)
