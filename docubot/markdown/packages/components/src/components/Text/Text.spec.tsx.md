Summary:
This file contains tests for the Text component, which is a reusable component for rendering text in a variety of formats. The tests ensure that the component renders correctly with different types of content, including embedded entries and assets, hyperlinks, and formatted text.

Import statements:
- React: the main React library
- each: a function from the lodash library for iterating over collections
- BLOCKS: an object from the @contentful/rich-text-types library containing constants for different types of rich text blocks
- mount: a function from the Cypress testing library for mounting components
- TextProps: a type definition for the props of the Text component
- Text: the Text component itself
- Router: the Next.js router library
- mockContent: a function for generating mock content for testing
- assetMock: a function for generating mock asset data for testing
- linkMock: a function for generating mock link data for testing
- variantNodeTypeMapper: an object mapping rich text block types to variant names
- createTextMock: a function for generating mock text data for testing
- testNodeType: a function for testing that the correct text is rendered for a given rich text block type

Component:
The Text component is a reusable component for rendering text in a variety of formats. It takes a prop called "body" that contains JSON data representing the text content to be rendered. The component uses this data to render the text in a format that matches the specified variant (e.g. "body1" for a paragraph).

Hooks:
- useRouter: a hook from the Next.js router library for accessing the router object

Event Handlers:
None

Rendered components:
None

Interaction Summary:
This file contains tests for the Text component, which is used throughout the application to render text content. The tests ensure that the component renders correctly with different types of content, including embedded entries and assets, hyperlinks, and formatted text. Developers working with this component may need to modify the variantNodeTypeMapper object to add support for new rich text block types, or modify the createTextMock function to generate different types of mock data for testing.

Developer Questions:
- What other props can be passed to the Text component besides "body"?
- How can I modify the variantNodeTypeMapper object to add support for a new rich text block type?
- How can I modify the createTextMock function to generate different types of mock data for testing?
- How does the Text component interact with other components in the application?
