Summary:
This file contains a function called useThemeProps that takes in props, a name, and a defaultTheme and returns mergedProps. It also contains a resolveProps function that merges defaultProps with props.

Import statements:
The file imports two modules: useTheme from '@mui/system' and ThemedProps, ThemeWithProps from '@mui/system/useThemeProps'.

Script Summary:
The useThemeProps function takes in props, a name, and a defaultTheme and returns mergedProps. It uses the useTheme hook to get the current theme and checks if the theme has a component with the given name and if that component has defaultProps. If it does, it merges the defaultProps with the given props and returns the mergedProps. If not, it returns the given props.

Internal Functions:
- resolveProps: This function takes in defaultProps and props and merges them. It creates a new object with all the properties of props and then loops through the keys of defaultProps. If the key is not in props or the value of the key in props is undefined or null, it sets the value of that key to the value of that key in defaultProps. It then returns the new object.

External Functions:
- useThemeProps: This function takes in props, a name, and a defaultTheme and returns mergedProps. It uses the useTheme hook to get the current theme and checks if the theme has a component with the given name and if that component has defaultProps. If it does, it calls the resolveProps function to merge the defaultProps with the given props and returns the mergedProps. If not, it returns the given props.

Interaction Summary:
This file is part of a larger application and is used to merge default props with user-defined props for components. It interacts with the useTheme hook from the '@mui/system' module to get the current theme and check if a component has defaultProps.
