Summary:
This file exports two functions, `createPaletteAccents` and `getPaletteAccents`, which are used to create and retrieve a set of color palettes for the application.

Import statements:
The file imports two modules, `PaletteAccent` and `colorSchemes`, from two different files in the same directory.

Script Summary:
The `createPaletteAccents` function creates a set of color palettes by iterating over the `colorSchemes` object and filtering out any schemes that do not have the `createPaletteAccent` property set to true. For each remaining scheme, it creates a new `PaletteAccent` object using the scheme and a `baseScheme` object, and adds it to the `paletteAccents` object. The function then returns the `paletteAccents` object.

The `getPaletteAccents` function simply calls `createPaletteAccents` and returns the resulting object.

Internal Functions:
- `createPaletteAccents`: creates a set of color palettes by iterating over the `colorSchemes` object and filtering out any schemes that do not have the `createPaletteAccent` property set to true. For each remaining scheme, it creates a new `PaletteAccent` object using the scheme and a `baseScheme` object, and adds it to the `paletteAccents` object. The function then returns the `paletteAccents` object.

External Functions:
- `getPaletteAccents`: calls `createPaletteAccents` and returns the resulting object.

Interaction Summary:
This file does not interact with any external third-party libraries or services. It simply creates and returns a set of color palettes for use within the application.

Developer Questions:
- What is the `PaletteAccent` object and how is it used?
- What is the `baseScheme` object and how is it used?
- How are the color palettes used within the application?
- How can I add or modify color schemes within the `colorSchemes` object?
- Are there any performance concerns with creating a large number of color palettes? 

Known Issues and TODOs:
There are no known issues or bugs with this component. However, a possible improvement could be to allow for dynamic creation of color palettes based on user preferences or settings.
