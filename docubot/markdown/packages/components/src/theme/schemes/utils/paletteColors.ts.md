Summary:
This file contains a function that creates a palette scheme based on a custom scheme or a default base scheme.

Import statements:
- PaletteScheme: a class that represents a palette scheme
- baseScheme: a constant that contains the base colors for the scheme

Script Summary:
The createSchemePalette function takes in a customScheme object and checks if it has a buildOptions property with a createScheme method. If it does, it creates a new PaletteScheme object using the customScheme and baseScheme as arguments. If not, it creates a new PaletteScheme object using the baseScheme as both arguments.

Internal Functions:
None

External Functions:
- createSchemePalette(customScheme: any): returns a new PaletteScheme object based on the customScheme or the baseScheme

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the PaletteScheme class and the baseScheme constant from the same directory. It could potentially be used by other components or modules that need to create a palette scheme.

Developer Questions:
- What is the structure of the customScheme object?
- What are the available options for the buildOptions property?
- How is the PaletteScheme class used in other parts of the application?
- How can I customize the baseScheme constant for my needs?
