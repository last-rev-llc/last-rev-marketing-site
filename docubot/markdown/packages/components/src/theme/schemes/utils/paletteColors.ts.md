Summary:
This file exports a function called `createSchemePalette` which takes in a custom color scheme and returns a new instance of `PaletteScheme` class. If the custom color scheme has a `buildOptions.createScheme` property, it is used to create the new instance, otherwise, the default color scheme is used.

Import statements:
- `PaletteScheme` from `../PaletteScheme`: This is a class that represents a color scheme.
- `baseScheme` from `../colors`: This is an object that contains the default color scheme.

Script Summary:
The `createSchemePalette` function takes in a custom color scheme as an argument. If the custom color scheme has a `buildOptions.createScheme` property, it is used to create a new instance of `PaletteScheme` class by passing the custom color scheme and the default color scheme as arguments. Otherwise, a new instance of `PaletteScheme` class is created by passing the default color scheme as both arguments.
