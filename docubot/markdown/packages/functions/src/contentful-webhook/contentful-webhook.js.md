Summary:
This file is a Lambda function that handles a webhook from Contentful CMS. It uses the `@last-rev/contentful-webhook-handler` package to handle the webhook and parse the event body. The function returns a success message if the webhook is handled successfully, or an error message if there is an error.

Import statements:
- `dotenv`: a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env.
- `handleWebhook`: a function from the `@last-rev/contentful-webhook-handler` package that handles the webhook.
- `config`: a configuration file that contains settings for the webhook handler.

Script Summary:
The Lambda function exports a single async function called `handler` that takes an event object as a parameter. The function first loads environment variables from a .env file using `dotenv`. It then calls the `handleWebhook` function with the `config` object, the parsed event body, and the event headers. If the webhook is handled successfully, the function returns a success message with a 200 status code. If there is an error, the function returns an error message with a 400 status code.

Internal Functions:
None.

External Functions:
- `handler(event)`: an async function that handles the webhook event. It takes an event object as a parameter and returns a Promise that resolves to an object with a statusCode, headers, and body.

Interaction Summary:
