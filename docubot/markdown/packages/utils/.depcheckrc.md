Interaction Summary:
This file does not directly interact with the rest of the application, but it is used by the depcheck package to check for unused dependencies. If the application has a dependency on "rollup", it will be ignored during the dependency check.

Developer Questions:
- What other packages can be ignored during the dependency check?
- How can I add or remove packages from the ignore list?
- What happens if a package is ignored but is actually being used in the application?
