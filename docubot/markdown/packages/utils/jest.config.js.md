Summary:
This file exports a Jest configuration object that specifies which files to ignore during testing and how to handle CSS, Less, and SCSS files.

Import statements:
None.

Script Summary:
The module.exports object specifies two properties: testPathIgnorePatterns and moduleNameMapper. The former is an array of file paths to ignore during testing, while the latter maps file extensions to a module that can handle them.

Internal Functions:
None.

External Functions:
None.

Interaction Summary:
This file is used by Jest to configure its testing environment. Other files in the application may import Jest and use this configuration object to run tests.

Developer Questions:
- What other configuration options are available for Jest?
- How can I add additional file extensions to the moduleNameMapper?
- What happens if a file that should be tested is not included in the testPathIgnorePatterns array?
