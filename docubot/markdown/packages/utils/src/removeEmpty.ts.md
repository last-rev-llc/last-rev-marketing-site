Summary:
This file contains a single function called "removeEmpty" which takes an object as input and returns a new object with all empty values removed.

Import statements:
None.

Script Summary:
The "removeEmpty" function takes an object as input and returns a new object with all empty values removed. It does this by first converting the input object into an array of key-value pairs using "Object.entries". It then filters out any pairs where the value is null or undefined using the "filter" method. Finally, it maps over the remaining pairs and recursively calls "removeEmpty" on any values that are themselves objects. The resulting array of pairs is then converted back into an object using "Object.fromEntries" and returned.

Internal Functions:
None.

External Functions:
- removeEmpty(obj: Object): Object
  - Description: Takes an object as input and returns a new object with all empty values removed.
  - Parameters:
    - obj: The input object to remove empty values from.
  - Returns:
    - A new object with all empty values removed.

Interaction Summary:
This file is a utility function that could potentially be used by any other part of the application that needs to remove empty values from an object.

Developer Questions:
- What is considered an "empty" value in this context?
- How deep does the recursion go when removing empty values from nested objects?
- Are there any performance concerns with using this function on very large objects or deeply nested objects?
