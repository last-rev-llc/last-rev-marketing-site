Summary:
This file contains a function that performs a deep merge of two objects.

Import statements:
None

Script Summary:
The merge function takes in a target object and one or more source objects, and recursively merges the source objects into the target object. If a key in the source object is an object itself, the function will recursively merge that object as well.

Internal Functions:
- isObject(item: any): This function checks if the given item is an object and not an array. It returns a boolean value.

External Functions:
- merge(target: any, ...sources: any[]): This function performs a deep merge of the target object and one or more source objects. It returns the merged object.

Interaction Summary:
This file can be imported and used in other parts of the application to perform deep merges of objects.

Developer Questions:
- What happens if one of the source objects is null or undefined?
- Can this function handle circular references in objects?
- How does this function handle conflicts when merging objects with the same key?
