Summary:
This file exports a GraphQL endpoint URL based on the environment variables set in the deployment platform. If the environment variable STAGE is set to 'build' or if the deployment URL is not available, it defaults to a local URL.

Import statements:
None

Script Summary:
- The script sets the deployUrl variable to either the DEPLOY_URL or VERCEL_URL environment variable, whichever is available.
- The graphqlEndpoint variable is set to either the local URL or the deployUrl URL depending on the STAGE environment variable and the availability of the deployUrl.
- The graphqlEndpoint is then exported as the default value of the module.

Internal Functions:
None

External Functions:
- default: exports the graphqlEndpoint URL as a string.

Interaction Summary:
This file is likely used by other modules in the application that require a GraphQL endpoint URL. The exported URL can be used to make GraphQL queries and mutations to the backend server. The file interacts with the deployment platform's environment variables to determine the appropriate URL to use.

Developer Questions:
- What is the purpose of the STAGE environment variable?
- What happens if both DEPLOY_URL and VERCEL_URL are not available?
- How is the graphqlEndpoint variable used in the rest of the application?
- Are there any other environment variables that affect the behavior of this file?
