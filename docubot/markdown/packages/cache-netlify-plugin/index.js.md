Summary:
This file contains a script that handles caching for a build process. It defines two functions that get cache directories and uses them to check if there is a cached version of the build available. If there is, it restores the cache, and if there isn't, it saves the cache after the build is complete.

Import statements:
The only import statement in this file is for the 'path' module.

Script Summary:
The script defines two functions, 'getCacheDirs' and an object with two async functions, 'onPreBuild' and 'onPostBuild'. The 'getCacheDirs' function takes in a 'constants' object and returns an array of cache directories. The 'onPreBuild' function takes in 'constants' and 'utils' objects, checks if there is a cached version of the build available, and restores it if there is. The 'onPostBuild' function takes in the same objects, saves the cache after the build is complete, and logs a message to the console.

Internal Functions:
- getCacheDirs: This function takes in a 'constants' object and returns an array of cache directories.

External Functions:
- onPreBuild: This function takes in 'constants' and 'utils' objects, checks if there is a cached version of the build available, and restores it if there is.
- onPostBuild: This function takes in the same objects, saves the cache after the build is complete, and logs a message to the console.

Interaction Summary:
This script interacts with the larger application by handling caching for the build process. It checks if there is a cached version of the build available and restores it if there is. It also saves the cache after the build is complete.

Developer Questions:
- What is the format of the 'constants' object that is passed to the 'getCacheDirs', 'onPreBuild', and 'onPostBuild' functions?
- What is the 'utils' object that is passed to the 'onPreBuild' and 'onPostBuild' functions, and what methods does it have?
- What is the purpose of the cache directories, and how are they used in the build process?
- How can I debug issues related to caching in the build process?
- Are there any known issues or bugs with the caching component, and are there any todo items that need to be addressed?
