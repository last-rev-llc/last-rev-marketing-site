This file exports a Jest configuration object that specifies the test path ignore patterns and a module name mapper for CSS, LESS, and SCSS files.

None.

Script Summary:
The module.exports object specifies two properties: testPathIgnorePatterns and moduleNameMapper. The testPathIgnorePatterns property is an array of strings that specify file paths to ignore during testing. The moduleNameMapper property is an object that maps file extensions to a module that can handle them. In this case, CSS, LESS, and SCSS files are mapped to the identity-obj-proxy module.

Developer Questions:
- What other Jest configuration files are being used in the application?
- How are the testPathIgnorePatterns and moduleNameMapper properties affecting the testing environment?
- What other modules are being used to handle CSS, LESS, and SCSS files in the application?
