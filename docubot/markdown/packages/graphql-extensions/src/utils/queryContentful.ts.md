Summary:
This file contains a function called `queryContentful` which is used to query the Contentful CMS for entries. It takes in parameters such as the content type, filters, and context and returns a Promise that resolves to an array of Contentful entries.

Import statements:
The file imports two modules: `ApolloContext` from `@last-rev/types` and `Entry` from `contentful`.

Script Summary:
The `queryContentful` function takes in an object with four properties: `contentType`, `filters`, `filter`, and `ctx`. It then constructs a query object with the `content_type` and `limit` properties, and adds any filters that are passed in. It then uses the `ctx` object to determine whether to query the preview or production environment, and returns the resulting items.

Internal Functions:
