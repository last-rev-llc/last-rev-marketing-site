Summary:
This file exports a function called `queryContentful` which takes in a set of parameters and returns a Promise that resolves to an array of Contentful entries. The function queries the Contentful API using the provided parameters and returns the resulting entries.

Import statements:
The file imports two modules: `ApolloContext` from `@last-rev/types` and `Entry` from `contentful`.

Script Summary:
The `queryContentful` function takes in four parameters: `contentType`, `filters`, `filter`, and `ctx`. `contentType` is a string that specifies the type of Contentful entry to query. `filters` is an array of objects that specify the fields to filter by. `filter` is an object that contains the filter values. `ctx` is an object that contains the Contentful API keys and other context information.

The function constructs a Contentful query object based on the provided parameters and queries the Contentful API using either the preview or production API key depending on the `ctx` object. The resulting entries are returned as an array.
