Summary:
This file exports a function called `parseRichTextField` which takes in a `richText` object and a `config` object as parameters. It then parses the `richText` object and returns an array of objects with `section` and `content` properties.

Import statements:
This file imports two functions and some types from two different packages: `documentToPlainTextString` and `Block`, `Inline`, `BLOCKS`, `Document`, and `Text` from `@contentful/rich-text-types`.

Script Summary:
This file exports a function called `parseRichTextField` which takes in a `richText` object and a `config` object as parameters. It then parses the `richText` object and returns an array of objects with `section` and `content` properties. The `parseNode` function is an internal function that is used to recursively parse the `richText` object.

Internal Functions:
- `parseNode`: This function takes in a `node`, `results`, and `config` as parameters. It is used to recursively parse the `richText` object. It uses a stack to keep track of the nodes to be parsed. It checks the `nodeType` of each node and if it is a `sectionDelimiter`, it sets the `section` variable to the text content of the node. If it is a `DOCUMENT`, it pushes the content of the node onto the stack. If it is a `text` node, it sets the `content` variable to the text content of the node. If it is any other type of node, it sets the `content` variable to the plain text content of the node. If the `content` variable is truthy, it pushes an object with `section` and `content` properties onto the `results` array.

External Functions:
- `parseRichTextField`: This function takes in a `richText` object and a `config` object as parameters. It checks if the `richText` object is truthy and then calls the `parseNode` function to parse the `richText` object. It returns an array of objects with `section` and `content` properties.

Interaction Summary:
This file is used to parse rich text content from Contentful and convert it into plain text. It could be used in any part of the application that needs to display rich text content as plain text.

Developer Questions:
- What is the format of the `richText` object that is passed into the `parseRichTextField` function?
- What is the `config` object used for and what are the possible values for `sectionDelimiter`?
- How is the `parseNode` function able to recursively parse the `richText` object?
- What is the purpose of the `section` property in the objects returned by the `parseRichTextField` function?
- What is the purpose of the `content` property in the objects returned by the `parseRichTextField` function?
