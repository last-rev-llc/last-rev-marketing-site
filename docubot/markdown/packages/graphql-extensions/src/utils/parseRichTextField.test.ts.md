Summary:
This file contains tests for the parseRichTextField function, which is used to parse rich text content from Contentful.

Import statements:
- parseRichTextField: the function being tested
- richText: a mock of rich text content from Contentful
- BLOCKS: an object containing constants for different types of content blocks in Contentful rich text
- describe: a function from the Jest testing library
- it: a function from the Jest testing library
- expect: a function from the Jest testing library

Script Summary:
The script contains two tests for the parseRichTextField function. The first test checks that the function returns an empty array when there is no content to parse. The second test checks that the function works correctly when there is content to parse.

Internal Functions:
None

External Functions:
- parseRichTextField: a function that takes in rich text content and a section delimiter and returns an array of sections. Each section is an object with a type and content property.

Interaction Summary:
This file is a test file and does not interact directly with the rest of the application. However, it tests a function that is used to parse rich text content from Contentful, so it is likely that this function is used in other parts of the application.

Developer Questions:
- What other parts of the application use the parseRichTextField function?
- What other types of content blocks are available in Contentful rich text besides the ones defined in BLOCKS?
- How can I modify the section delimiter parameter to split the content into different sections?
