Summary:
This file contains code that defines type mappings, resolvers, and paths generators for the Page and Topic types in a GraphQL schema. It also imports various dependencies and utility functions.

Import statements:
- `graphql-tag`: a library for parsing GraphQL queries
- `lodash/capitalize`: a utility library for capitalizing strings
- `@last-rev/graphql-contentful-core`: a library for working with Contentful data in GraphQL
- `@last-rev/types`: a library containing various types used in the application
- `@last-rev/graphql-contentful-extensions`: a library containing extensions for working with Contentful data in GraphQL
- `./utils/createType`: a custom utility function for creating a new GraphQL type

Script Summary:
- Defines an empty object `typeMappings`
- Defines a constant `BLOGS_LANDING_ID` with a Contentful ID
- Defines a utility function `createPath` for creating a URL path from a list of strings
- Defines a constant `WRAPPER_SECTION_SETTINGS` with settings for various section types
- Defines a resolver function `pageContentsResolver` for resolving the contents of a Page type
- Defines a resolver function `topicContentsResolver` for resolving the contents of a Topic type
- Defines a `mappers` object with resolvers for the Page and Topic types
- Defines a `typeDefs` object with type definitions for the Page and Topic types
- Defines two path generator functions `page` and `topic` for generating URL paths for Page and Topic types
- Defines a `pathsConfigs` object with the `page` and `topic` path generators

Internal Functions:
- `createPath(...slug: string[])`: takes a list of strings and returns a URL path
- `pageContentsResolver(page: any, _args: any, ctx: ApolloContext)`: takes a Page object and returns its contents
- `topicContentsResolver(_: any, _args: any, ctx: ApolloContext)`: takes a Topic object and returns its contents
- `page(pageItem, _loaders, defaultLocale, _locales, _preview = false, _site)`: takes a Contentful Page object and returns a path object
- `topic(topicItem, _loaders, defaultLocale, _locales, _preview = true)`: takes a Contentful Topic object and returns a path object

External Functions:
None

Interaction Summary:
This file defines resolvers and path generators for the Page and Topic types in a GraphQL schema. These resolvers and path generators are used by other parts of the application to resolve data and generate URLs.
