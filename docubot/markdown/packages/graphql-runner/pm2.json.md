Summary:
This configuration file sets up the GraphQL runner service for the larger application. It specifies the script to run, the number of instances to run, the execution mode, and the arguments to pass to the script.

Service:
The GraphQL runner service is responsible for serving GraphQL queries and mutations to the application. It integrates with the Last Rev CLI and uses a configuration file to determine how to serve the GraphQL schema.

Configuration Summary:
This configuration file sets up the GraphQL runner service to run in cluster mode with four instances. It specifies the script to run, the arguments to pass to the script, and the directories to watch for changes.

Configuration Breakdown:
- "script": The path to the script that will be run by the service.
- "instances": The number of instances to run in cluster mode.
- "exec_mode": The execution mode for the service (in this case, cluster mode).
- "args": The arguments to pass to the script when it is run.
- "watch": The directories to watch for changes. If any files in these directories change, the service will be restarted.

Interaction Summary:
This configuration file interacts with the rest of the application by providing the GraphQL runner service. It determines how the GraphQL schema is served and how many instances of the service are running.

Developer Questions:
- What is the purpose of the GraphQL runner service?
- How does the configuration file determine how to serve the GraphQL schema?
- What happens if the number of instances is changed?
- What directories are being watched for changes and why?
