Summary:
This file exports an object that contains configuration options for a resource that is used to query a GraphQL server. It also sets a timeout for the server and specifies whether SSL should be enforced.

Import statements:
The file imports the dotenv package to load environment variables from a .env file.

Script Summary:
The script sets a URL for the GraphQL server by checking if the GRAPHQL_SERVER environment variable is set and using it if it is, otherwise it defaults to http://localhost:5000/graphql. It then appends a query to the URL that requests the schema types. The resource variable is set to a TCP URL that is extracted from the GraphQL server URL. The timeout variable is set to the value of the GRAPHQL_SERVER_TIMEOUT environment variable if it is set, otherwise it defaults to 0. Finally, an object is exported that contains the delay, interval, verbose, strictSSL, followRedirect, timeout, and resources options.
