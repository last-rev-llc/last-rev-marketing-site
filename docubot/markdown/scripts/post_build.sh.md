Summary:
This script is a post-build script written in Bash. It performs some cleanup if the GraphQL runner strategy is not defined or is set to "fs". It also kills the GraphQL PM2 process.

Dependencies:
This script depends on yarn and the GraphQL runner package.

Code Summary:
The script first checks if the GraphQL runner strategy is set to "fs" or is not defined. If so, it performs some cleanup by renaming the "!gitignore" file to ".gitignore" in the GraphQL runner package. It then kills the GraphQL PM2 process.

Interaction Summary:
This script is part of a larger application and is likely called after the build process is complete. It interacts with the GraphQL runner package and the GraphQL PM2 process.

Developer Questions:
- What is the purpose of the GraphQL runner package?
- What is the GraphQL PM2 process and why is it being killed?
- What other post-build scripts are being used in the application?
- What happens if the GraphQL runner strategy is set to something other than "fs"?
