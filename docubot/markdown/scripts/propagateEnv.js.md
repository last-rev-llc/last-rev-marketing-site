Summary:
This script propagates the .env file to all packages in the packages directory.

Import statements:
- fs-extra: A Node.js module that extends the fs module with additional functionality.
- path: A Node.js module that provides utilities for working with file and directory paths.

Script Summary:
- The script first resolves the file paths for the .env file and the packages directory.
- It then reads the contents of the packages directory and stores the list of package names in the packages variable.
- The script then iterates over each package name and copies the .env file to the package's directory.
- If an error occurs during the copying process, the script logs the error to the console.
- Finally, the script logs a success message to the console and exits with a status code of 0 if the copying process was successful, or a status code of 1 if an error occurred.

Internal Functions:
- None.

External Functions:
- None.

Interaction Summary:
- This script interacts with the file system by reading and copying files.
- It could potentially interact with other scripts or modules that rely on the .env file being present in each package directory.

Developer Questions:
- What is the purpose of the .env file and why is it being propagated to each package directory?
- What happens if a package directory already contains a .env file?
- What happens if a package directory is added or removed while the script is running?
- Are there any other scripts or modules that rely on the .env file being present in each package directory?
