Summary:
This file is responsible for combining code coverage reports from multiple packages in the application and generating a single HTML report. It uses the 'child_process' module to execute shell commands and the 'fs' module to read and write files.

Import statements:
- path: a built-in Node.js module for working with file paths
- fs: a built-in Node.js module for working with the file system
- child_process: a built-in Node.js module for executing shell commands

Script Summary:
The script first creates a 'reports' folder if it doesn't exist already. It then reads the contents of the 'packages' folder and for each subfolder, it looks for a 'coverage-final.json' file in the 'coverage' subfolder. If found, it copies the file to the 'reports' folder with a filename of '{subfolder}.json'. It also adds the path of the copied file to an array called 'reports'.

Next, it creates a '.nyc_output' folder if it doesn't exist already. It then executes three shell commands using the 'execPromise' function:
- 'npx nyc merge reports': merges all the coverage reports in the 'reports' folder into a single file called 'coverage.json'
- 'mv coverage.json .nyc_output/out.json': moves the 'coverage.json' file to the '.nyc_output' folder and renames it to 'out.json'
- 'npx nyc -t ./.nyc_output report --reporter=html': generates an HTML report using the 'out.json' file and saves it in the '.nyc_output' folder

Internal Functions:
- execPromise(command): a function that takes a shell command as a parameter and returns a Promise that resolves with the output of the command if successful, or rejects with an error if unsuccessful.

External Functions:
None

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with other parts of the application by generating a code coverage report that can be used to identify areas of the code that need improvement. It may be called by other scripts or modules in the application to generate the report.

Developer Questions:
- What is the purpose of the 'reports' folder and how is it used?
- What is the 'nyc' package and how does it work?
- How can I customize the HTML report generated by this script?
- What happens if a 'coverage-final.json' file is not found for a package?
