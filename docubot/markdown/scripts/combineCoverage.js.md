Summary:
This file is responsible for merging and generating code coverage reports for all packages in the application. It reads the coverage-final.json files from each package's coverage folder, copies them to a reports folder, merges them using nyc, and generates an HTML report.

Import statements:
- path: a Node.js module for working with file paths
- fs: a Node.js module for working with the file system
- child_process: a Node.js module for spawning child processes

Script Summary:
- Defines constants for the starting path and the reports path
- Defines a function to execute a command and return a promise
- Checks if the reports folder exists, and creates it if it doesn't
- Reads the list of folders in the starting path
- For each folder, it tries to copy the coverage-final.json file to the reports folder and adds the filename to a list of reports
- Checks if the .nyc_output folder exists, and creates it if it doesn't
- Merges the reports using nyc and renames the output file to out.json
- Generates an HTML report using nyc

Internal Functions:
- execPromise(command: string): a function that takes a command string and returns a promise that resolves with the stdout output or rejects with the error or stderr output

External Functions:
None

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the file system and spawns child processes to execute nyc commands. It does not interact with any other components directly.

Developer Questions:
- What is the format of the coverage-final.json file?
- What happens if a package does not have a coverage-final.json file?
- What happens if the nyc commands fail?
- How can I customize the HTML report generated by nyc?
- Can I change the starting path or reports path?
