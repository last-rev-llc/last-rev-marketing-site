Summary:
This is a configuration file named turbo.json that is used in a larger application. It contains settings for a pipeline that includes various tasks such as building, testing, and starting the application.

Service:
The service that this configuration file is for is not specified in the file.

Configuration Summary:
The configuration file sets up a pipeline with various tasks that can be run, such as building the application, running tests, and starting the application. It also specifies dependencies between tasks and whether or not to use caching for certain tasks.

Configuration Breakdown:
- "$schema": specifies the schema for the configuration file
- "baseBranch": specifies the base branch for the repository
- "globalDependencies": specifies global dependencies that should be installed before running any tasks
- "pipeline": specifies the pipeline with various tasks and their dependencies and outputs
  - "dev": a task for development that depends on the build task and has caching disabled
  - "storybook": a task for running Storybook that depends on the build task and has caching disabled
  - "lint": a task for linting the code with no outputs
  - "test": a task for running tests that depends on the build task and has outputs in the coverage directory
  - "test:e2e": a task for running end-to-end tests that depends on the build task and a PERCY_TOKEN environment variable and has outputs in the coverage directory
  - "test:watch": a task for running tests in watch mode that depends on the build task and has caching disabled and no outputs
  - "build": a task for building the application that depends on itself and has outputs in the dist and .next directories
  - "build-storybook": a task for building Storybook that depends on the build task and has outputs in the storybook-static directory
  - "sync:cms": a task for syncing with a CMS that has caching disabled and depends on a separate task from a different repository
  - "start": a task for starting the application that has caching disabled, depends on the build task, and has no outputs
  - "gql:healthcheck": a task for checking the health of the GraphQL server that has caching disabled and no outputs
  - "@last-rev-marketing-site/graphql-runner#dev": a task for running the GraphQL runner in development mode that has caching disabled, depends on a task from a different repository, and has no outputs
  - "@last-rev-marketing-site/graphql-runner#start": a task for starting the GraphQL runner that has caching disabled, depends on a task from a different repository, and has no outputs
  - "@last-rev-marketing-site/utils#dev": a task for running utilities in development mode that has caching disabled, depends on a task from a different repository, and has no outputs
  - "@last-rev-marketing-site/graphql-sdk#dev": a task for running the GraphQL SDK in development mode that has caching disabled, depends on a healthcheck task and the build task, and has no outputs
  - "@last-rev-marketing-site/graphql-sdk#build": a task for building the GraphQL SDK that depends on a healthcheck task and the build task and has outputs in the dist directory and a schema.graphql file
  - "@last-rev-marketing-site/web#dev": a task for running the web application in development mode that has caching disabled, depends on tasks from different repositories and the build task, and has outputs in the out and .next directories
  - "@last-rev-marketing-site/web#build": a task for building the web application that has caching disabled, depends on tasks from different repositories and the build task, and has outputs in the out and .next directories

Interaction Summary:
This configuration file sets up a pipeline with various tasks that can be run to build, test, and start the application. The tasks have dependencies on each other and some tasks have outputs that are used by other tasks. The configuration file also specifies global dependencies that should be installed before running any tasks.

Developer Questions:
- What is the purpose of the globalDependencies array?
- What is the purpose of the baseBranch setting?
- What is the purpose of the cache setting for each task?
- What is the purpose of the dependsOn array for each task?
- What is the purpose of the outputs array for each task?
- What is the purpose of the "@" notation in some of the task names?
- What is the purpose of the schema.graphql file that is output by the "@last-rev-marketing-site/graphql-sdk#build" task?
