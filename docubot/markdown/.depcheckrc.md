# README for this file

## TODO Items
- [ ] Add more test cases to improve code coverage
- [ ] Refactor the code to improve readability and maintainability
- [ ] Add support for additional file formats

## Known Issues
- The application crashes when processing large files due to memory constraints. This needs to be addressed by implementing a streaming approach for file processing.
- The output format for certain file types is not consistent with the expected format. This needs to be fixed by updating the output formatting logic.

## Ignored Packages
The following packages have been ignored during installation and are not required for the application to function:
- typescript
- tslib
- prettier-*
- postinstall-postinstall
- netlify-cli
- cross-env
